I discovered that my search terms were insufficient, thankfully before I got too far along in the screening process.
Not only had my search somehow left out all years prior to 2015, but also did not include papers that should have been included.

I ended up running through several different combinations of terms. Some search combinations resulted in over 2 million hits, 
while others were far too exclusive. 

I think my current search terms are sufficiently broad yet exclusive. I yielded just over 5k results, and refined that down 
to 4,458 studies which is a more reasonable number to screen. 

In addition, the studies and terms that "should" have been included in that search (e.g., Berven, Skelly, Ghalambor, etc.) 
were included. I have now downloaded these studies and processed them through metagear. 

They are in the google doc folder ready for screening.

Updated (and hopefully final) search criteria: 

("cogradient variation" OR "countergradient variation" OR "cogradient selection" OR "countergradient selection" 
OR "co-gradient variation" OR "counter-gradient variation" OR "co-gradient selection" OR "counter-gradient selection") 
OR ("GxE" OR "genotype by environment" OR "gene by environment") 
OR ("nonadaptive plast*" OR "non-adaptive plast*" OR "maladaptive plast*" OR "adaptive plast*") 
OR ("phenotypic plasticity" AND "adapt*") 
AND ("common garden" OR "reciprocal transplant")
