Plotted results of first sim: As suspected, I focused on a wider range of effect sizes than are perhaps applicable/relevant. 
For example, it is clear that power is high after the effect size reaches 10 across all sample sizes (except 1). 

I will follow this simulation up with another that focuses more on that range of values that power is changing a lot. 
Next sim will run:
replicate = c(1:100)
samplesize = seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 0.25)
diff_effect = seq(from = 1, to = 40, by = 1)

That should produce sufficient resolution to make a more classic heatmap rather than line plot. May be able to interpolate lines? We'll see.
