To overcome difficulty in understanding gradient level analysis, I worked through a couple situations and met with Katie. 

Issue: Uncertainty over whether we would know what environment each genotype originates in, which then obfuscates ability to calculate E_means.

Resolved: Studies may not explicitly state environmental values for each genotype's origin. 
However, in order to include them in this analysis, we must always know the environment (or range of environments) that genotypes originate within.

It may not be totally clear within each paper, so we can collect yes/no data on whether or not this information was included which will be informative for the paper. 
There may be few studies with sufficient information to include in these analyses. 

For Analyses, when environmental data for each genotype is included:

Key for terms: 
E_hat = average environmental value across range of environments included in experiment (mean of x-axis)
E_mean = mean/median environmental value at each genotype's origin. 
G_mean = mean/median phenotypic value presented by each genotype at E_hat

Each genotype will generate range of phenotypes across a range of native environments. (See below) 

Thus, E_mean for each genotype will be the average environmental state for each genotype.

Similarly, we can calculate G_means by estimating average phenotype for each genotype at the average environmental value (E_hat)
