# Simulation Results Round 3

In a previous notebook [post](https://github.com/RCN-ECS/CnGV/blob/master/notebook/20200408_KEL_MultiplePop_CnGv_GxE_UPDATE2.Rmd), Katie identified that we are getting biased covariance estimates that went down as n_pop went up. Katie identified that scaling the data disproportionately affects the Emean or Gmean estimates.
