```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



```{r}
results_folder <- 
figures_folder <- 
simIDs <- c(10621, 15539, 1843, 2715, 3443, 3508, 8313, 9034)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
