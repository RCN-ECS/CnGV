I have gone back and forth on whether to use bootstrapping or permutation to assign significance to CovGE. So here are some plots to guide decisions. 

## False Positives 

Per Katie's instruction - False positives are subject to residual error and sampling design. 

Below I have plotted false positive rates for each metric (Covariance + bootstrap, Covariance + permutation, etc.) using the larger residual error (standard deviation = 1) according to sampling design.
