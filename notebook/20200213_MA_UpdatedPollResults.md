# Updated Consortium Poll Results

The original plots from the consortium poll can be found [here](https://github.com/RCN-ECS/CnGV/blob/master/notebook/20191205_MA_PollResults.md):

Here are the updated plots to reflect the likert data and the "rank" data (which we now know was not, in fact, a rank). 

## Likert Data

These data were coded according to the below table. Some people selected 2 rankings which are reflected below. I then took the sum of each question's ranking according to each subject (Evolutionary Biology, Marine Science) and created the stacked bar chart below. 

| Response | Value Assigned |
| --- | --- | 
| Very Important | 5 |
| Very Important/Somewhat Important | 4 |
| Somewhat Important | 3 |
| Somewhat Important/Not Important | 2 |
| Not Important | 1 |

## "Rank" Data

In this set of questions, users picked three questions for each subject (Evolutionary biology, Marine Science, and Conservation biology) that are most needed to advance the field. These are coded simply - if the user chose the question, it was assigned a "1". The number of times each question was selected was then tallied.  

### "Rank" plot

#### Updated 2.25.20202
Below: This plot is filled relative to the average tallies (mean = 11 tallies per question). If the question was selected more than average, it is colored peach. The color white is for tallies near average, blue is if the question was selected less than average. Because more seem to be below average I also looked at the median value, which is 9. This disparity suggests that a few questions are driving the average and we may consider using the median?

#### Original plots
Below: Y axis ordered from its own rank - the most cumulative tallies are at the top, the least are at the bottom

## Added Questions
Users were given the option to provide other questions that were left off the questionaire that they felt should be included. Here are those responses: 
| Question | 
| --- | 
| What are the consequences of enormous population sizes and enormous fecundity (as seen in many marine species) for the evolutionary process?|
| For me, by far the most significant evolutionary question is about the conditions that allow species to adapt to future climate? Which species will be most likely to? And how much will such adaptation slow the ecosystem impacts of climate change in the oceans? Most of your questions address this at some level, but they are far too deep in the weeds. Each system will demand a slightly different approach. But the key thing is to keep the above questions paramount.|
| What is the role of mating system variation in determining the adaptive potential for species in changing environments?|
|I think it is important to understand the degree to which phenotypic plasticity provides a potentially adaptive (and hidden) resevoir of variation on which selection may act under future environmental conditions. I recognize there were questions about epigenetics etc, but it strikes me that they were not considering the inherent potential for plasticity to introduce novel phenotypes to future selective regimes.  |
| Can we use what we know about the natural history of species, their genetics, and their ecological/evolutionary context, to best predict which species and/or ecosystems are most vulnerable/resistant to aniticipated climate change?  In the case of vulnerable species/ecosystems, can we also use what we know to approach a management solution?|
| One of the main holes in our knowledge IMO is understanding the nature of intrapopulation/interindividual variation in both sensitivity (genetically based or otherwise) and exposure (the very local environmental conditions that they are exposed to), and how these either match or mismatch.  Any discussion of local adaptation first has to consider what selection/evolution has to act on.  Note that this is not necessarily equivalent to "selective gradients" at small scales but instead asks how much does environmental variation limit the potential for local adaptation, or, conversely, how can it potentially enhance population survival?|
| Importance of quantifying the extent and basis of inter-individual variation within populations |
|What are the traits of species (or populations) and particular marine environments that will allow species to adapt to climate change?  Which species (or habitats) will not be able to keep pace with a changing world?  |
| Now that we are in a post "model" species world (at least IMO), where we can develop or generate genomic resources for virtually any and every marine species of evolutionary interest, I would argue some of us still struggle with asking interesting but sometimes really  tough evolutionary questions about species that are pretty challenging to work with. Should we consider developing or focusing research on 'model marine species' with characteristics that make them ideal for experimentation (short generation time, easily cultured, etc), but are also relevant ecologically? e.g. Crepidula, certain Calanus copepods, Nematostella etc. Would be impossible to choose 1 or even a few of course, but to think about how the community might focus on a number of these models, i.e. a large-scale  collaborative effort over a number of years,  that could accelerate progress towards answering some of the major questions we are asking (i.e. the priorities in this survey) in all of our various species of interest. |
| Relative importance of different mechanisms by which adaptive genetic variation is maintained, and how they vary across life history types (including but broader than temporal variation and generation time)|
|Why does the speciation rate vary so much?  How important is balancing selection in maintaining genetic variation?  What factors cause the extent of sexual dimorphism to vary so much?  Will evolution in the seas, especially of keystone taxa, keep up with the rate of climate change?  How important are eco-evolutionary dynamics in fisheries and managed populations generally? (The questions listed were not ones I find so important or interesting, sorry to say) |
| Under which environmental conditions, in which taxa, and with what frequency does non-genetic phenotypic variation (i.e., adaptive plasticity) act as an alternative to genetic adaptation for population survival?|
|How can we combine information from multiple distinct datasets (e.g., species occurrences, fossils, genomic data) to infer historical demography and Quaternary range dynamics?  |
