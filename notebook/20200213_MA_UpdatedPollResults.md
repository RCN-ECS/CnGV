# Updated Consortium Poll Plots

The original plots from the consortium poll can be found [here](https://github.com/RCN-ECS/CnGV/blob/master/notebook/20191205_MA_PollResults.md):

Here are the updated plots to reflect the likert data and the "rank" data (which we now know was not, in fact, a rank). 

## Likert Data

These data were coded according to the below table. Some people selected 2 rankings which are reflected below. I then took the sum of each question's ranking according to each subject (Evolutionary Biology, Marine Science) and created the stacked bar chart below. 

| Response | Value Assigned |
| --- | --- | 
| Very Important | 3 |
| Very Important/Somewhat Important | 2.5 |
| Somewhat Important | 2 |
| Somewhat Important/Not Important | 1.5 |
| Not Important | 1 |

#### Axis Question reference
| Number | Question | Keywords |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q18 | What are the reasons for genetic divergence in the sea within and/or among species? | genetic divergence |
| Q29 | How will environmental change interact with different reproduction strategies (e.g. broadcast spawning, brooding, sex determination) to alter reproductive success? | reproduction strategies|
|Q30 | How can we quantify additive genetic variance (e.g., heritability) effectively in systems where pair-mated cross designs or pedigrees are not feasible?|additive genetic variance |
|Q31 |How can an understanding of adaptation to multiple stressors be used to predict responses to multivariate environmental change or novel environments?  |multiple stressors |
| Q32|When high genetic drift (e.g. sweepstakes reproductive success), strong selection, and high gene flow all occur at the same life stage (e.g. larval dispersal), what are the relative importance of each process to evolutionary outcomes?  |genetic drift and gene flow|
| Q33|What is the role of hybridization/introgression in range expansion (or lack thereof) to new habitats? | hybridization/introgression|
| Q34|How and which dispersal traits are evolving in response to environmental change?  |dispersal traits |
|Q35 |What is the relative importance of rapid evolution versus acclimation via plasticity to environmental change?  |evolution vs. acclimation |
| Q36|For restoration and assisted evolution efforts, can we use genomics to predict fitness of genotypes in particular environments (with limited knowledge of the underlying genetic architecture)?  | restoration genomics|
|Q37 |Do species with large effective population size have unexpected outcomes for population genetic processes?  | effective population size|
|Q38|What will nearshore climates be like in the future? (i.e., if we lack good predictions of ocean climate, how can we experiment under future conditions if we donâ€™t know what those are?) |nearshore climates |
| Q39|What oceanographic and biological processes contribute to genetic load, and how does the geographic distribution of load affect adaptation? |genetic load|
| Q40|How does variation in selection or plasticity across different life history stages constrain or promote adaptation? | life history stages |
|Q41 |What is the relative contribution of temporal fluctuating selection to maintaining variation in populations for short vs. long generation times?  |fluctuating selection |
|Q42 | How do the genetics and geography of local adaptation interact with oceanographic processes to predict (or not) future evolvability? | oceanographic processes |
|Q43 |Can epigenetic or plastic responses to environmental stress be inherited and alter evolutionary processes? |epigenetics |
|Q44 |How do eco-evolutionary feedbacks alter productivity and biogeochemical cycles in the ocean?  |biogeochemical cycles|
|Q45 |Under what conditions will evolutionary processes accelerate (e.g.  mutational meltdowns or Allee effects) or prevent (e.g. evolutionary rescue) extinctions? |accelerate or prevent|
|Q46|At spatial scales below the dispersal distance, how do spatial patterns of selective gradients create patterns of local adaptation (microgeographic adaptation)? |microgeographic adaptation|
| Q47|Under what conditions does the evolved plastic response predict the evolutionary response?  |plasticity predict |
| Q48| How do microbial symbiont(s) or microbiomes affect the adaptation or acclimation of their hosts to a changing environment?|microbial symbionts|
