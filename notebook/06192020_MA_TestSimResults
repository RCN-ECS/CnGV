Try 2. I had an entire post written and the mother fucking internet cut out and I lost the whole damn thing. ARGH. 

I ran a test set of sims to ensure the new GxE code and all my functions were working. I ran the following parameters: 
```{r}

# Starting list of parameters
param_list <- list( 
  reps = c(5), 
  delta_env = c(0.01,0.5,1),
  delta_gen = c(-1,0.01,1),
  sample_size = c(5,10),
  n_pop = c(1), # Number of pops per environment
  n_environments = c(2,5,10),
  std_dev= c(0.5,1.5),
  interaction = 2) # Vector LENGTH not magnitude

```
