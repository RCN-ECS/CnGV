# 2019 RCN Poll Results

During the first RCN workshop, discussions centered around determining research areas of priority. In November 2019, a survey was sent to the RCN members that attended the workshop at Shoals Marine Lab to formally assess the importance and priority of the research foci identified during the workshop. Below are plots depicting poll results.

## User profiles

In total, 118 unique IP addresses completed the survey. The median time to complete the survey was ~14 minutes. 

The majority of polls were filled out by individuals with a PhD, with both sexes fairly equally represented.

The poll was taken by researchers spread around the globe.

The following shows the study topics (Q13 in the poll), research biomes (Q14), focal organisms (Q16), and research approaches (Q17) of the polled individuals. Most individuals study ecology and evolution, work in the marine biome, and use empirical approaches to study animals.

## Decision making factors
The questions of the poll asked members to rank various questions according to perceived importance. To determine how members determined importance, we asked members to rank various factors that affected their decisions. THe novelty of the research question was ranked highly across many members, while potential for funding and high impact publications were factors that affected decisions the least. Relevance to personal interest/experience and application to society/conservation/industry were generally important.

## Important questions for marine science and evolutionary biology
Users were asked to rate a series of ~20 questions in terms of their importance for advancing the fields of marine science and/or evolutionary biology. 

Most questions were ranked as very or somewhat important for both fields. The question that received the most "very important" for evolutionary biology was, "How can an understanding of adaptation to multiple stressors be used to predict responses to multivariate environmental change or novel environments? (Q31)". The question that received the most "very important" rankings for marine science was, "What is the relative importance of rapid evolution versus acclimation via plasticity to environmental change? (Q35)". 

The question that received the most "not important" rankings for evolutionary biology were Q44, "How do eco-evolutionary feedbacks alter productivity and biogeochemical cycles in the ocean?" and Q38, "What will nearshore climates be like in the future? (i.e., if we lack good predictions of ocean climate, how can we experiment under future conditions if we don’t know what those are?)" The question that received the most "not important" rankings for marince science were Q37, "Do species with large effective population size have unexpected outcomes for population genetic processes?" and Q36, "For restoration and assisted evolution efforts, can we use genomics to predict fitness of genotypes in particular environments (with limited knowledge of the underlying genetic architecture)?"

The X-axis refers to the questions which can be found [here](https://github.com/RCN-ECS/CnGV/blob/master/data/Consortium%20Poll%20Results/RCN_Survey_10-30-19.docx) and listed below.

## Pick Top Three
Users were asked to choose up to 3 questions that they think are most important for advancing evolutionary biology, marine . science, and conservation and management. For evolutionary biology, the question that recieved the most top rankings was "What is the relative importance of rapid evolution versus acclimation via plasticity to environmental change?" 

*Note that the x-axis of the following three plots are keywords that match the language of the original question as the full questions did not fit.*

The question that received the most top rankings for marine science was, "How can an understanding of adaptation to multiple stressors be used to predict responses to multivariate environmental change or novel environments?"

Finally, the highest ranked question for conservation and management was, "For restoration and assisted evolution efforts, can we use genomics to predict fitness of genotypes in particular environments (with limited knowledge of the underlying genetic architecture)? "
