# 20201109 Meeting notes

* Make the manuscript as complete as possible through Results section, as if we were submitting for peer review

* Check that all approaches for raw data vs. means data are as parallel as possible 
  * Standardization by group means vs. all phenotypic means - what we had talked about back in August vs. in manuscript
  * Hypothesis test as delta-GxE=0 (raw data?) vs. delta-GxE = G+E (means data?)
    * At one point I remember digging into the weird null distribution for GxE being created by the permutation? I thought I made a markdown for it, need to find which post this is in.
  
* Confusion matrix presentation - things to discuss and decide
  * While the "overall" confusion matrices are useful for us, I am hesitant to present them in the main text because the true positive / 
  false negative rates depend on the study design and magnitude of the CovGE
    * For example, Fig 4 could be limited to all studies with 128 total sample size or something like that
  * Determine what designs false positives and false negatives are coming from
  * Compare ANOVA confusion matrix to our GxE approach
  * Confusion matrix rates are not consistent across Recip. Trans vs. Paired common garden

* Make a full list of all other things that we need to check and discuss - or not passing sanity checks
  * Write out our equations for the population parameter calculation vs. the sample estimates - especially for Cov-GE.
  * Explain the clustering approach for paired common garden sims for clearly
  * Make an outline for the discussion with Geoff
  * Make sure to have 1000 sims of CovGE = 0 for FPRs
  * Make sure to have 1000 sims of GxE = 0 for FPRs
  * Paired common garden why actual cov GE not covering large values?
  

* In https://github.com/RCN-ECS/CnGV/blob/master/notebook/20201016_MA_FullSimResults.md
  * 
 
  
* Make a new notebook post so that we have the results to compare to last post
