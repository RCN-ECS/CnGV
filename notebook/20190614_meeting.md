### Population-level analysis
- straightforward when the genotype corresponds to an environment for a population. For example, we have coastal and inland frogs and we do a reciprocal transplant.  Both the environment and the genotype are factors.

phen | gen | env
---|---|---|
1.1 | G1 | E1
2.1 | G1 | E1
2.0 | G2 | E1
1.8 | G2 | E1
1.1 | G1 | E2
2.1 | G1 | E2
2.0 | G2 | E2
1.8 | G2 | E2

- our simulations are set up for when we know exactly what environment the genotypes came from


### Gradient-level analysis
- but we may have many studies where genotypes are grown across many environmental variables, such that the G vector (number of genotypes) and E vector (the environments the genotypes are grown at) are different lengths
- in this case, we need to know what environment that genotype came from, so that we can make the G vector and E vector the same lengths
- and, the environments that the genotypes came from may not have been measured in the experiment. Environment is continuous

phen | gen | env
---|---|---|
1.1 | G1 | 100
2.1 | G1 | 110
2.0 | G2 | 110
1.8 | G2 | E1
1.1 | G1 | E2
2.1 | G1 | E2
2.0 | G2 | E2
1.8 | G2 | E2
