### Population-level analysis
- straightforward when the genotype corresponds to an environment for a population. For example, we have coastal and inland frogs and we do a reciprocal transplant.  Both the environment and the genotype are factors.

phen | gen | env
---|---|---|
1.1 | G1 | E1
2.1 | G1 | E1
2.0 | G2 | E1
1.8 | G2 | E1
1.1 | G1 | E2
2.1 | G1 | E2
2.0 | G2 | E2
1.8 | G2 | E2

- our simulations are set up for when we know exactly what environment the genotypes came from


### Gradient-level analysis
- but we may have many studies where genotypes are grown across many environmental variables, such that the G vector (number of genotypes) and E vector (the environments the genotypes are grown at) are different lengths
- in this case, we need to know what environment that genotype came from, so that we can make the G vector and E vector the same lengths
- and, the environments that the genotypes came from may not have been measured in the experiment. Environment is continuous

-Assume the phenotype is standardized (table 1)

phen | gen | env
---|---|---|
1.1 | G1 | 100
2.1 | G1 | 110
2.0 | G2 | 105
1.8 | G2 | 115
1.1 | G3 | 102
2.1 | G3 | 112
2.0 | G4 | 103
1.8 | G4 | 113

In this case, we need a table indicating the environmental values that each genotype evolved in (table 2)

gen | env
---|---|
G1 | 101
G2 | 105
G3 | 107
G4 | 109

Where we want to go: (table 2)

gen | env | G_mean | E_mean
---|---| ---|---|
G1 | 101 |  1.1| 1.1|
G2 | 105 | 1.2| 1.2|
G3 | 107 | 1.3| 1.3|
G4 | 109 | 1.4| 1.4|

We can calculate the average genotype effect across all environments. Calculate the linear regression phen~Env for each genotype from table 1, for the G_mean, calculate the predicted phenotype at the mean or median environmental value from table 1.

We can calculate the average environment effect across all genotypes. Calculate the linear regression phen~Env for each genotype from Table 1,  and for the E_mean average the predicted phenotype at given environmental value for all genotypes

*Observed cov(G,E) would be cov(G_mean, E_mean)

#### Next step would be to calculate the CI
Bootstrap to create a new table 1. Sample with replacement datapoints within each genotype, recalculate the linear regression equation and recalculate the G_mean, E_mean and covariance between them.
