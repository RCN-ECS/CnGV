# Results from most recent simulation runs 

I ran a (hopefully) final round of simulations last week. The plots here are arranged as they would appear in the paper. As a reminder, figure 1 and 2 are heuristic plots and not generated from simulated data. 
Supplementary materials are located below the main 7 plots.
