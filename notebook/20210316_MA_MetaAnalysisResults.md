# Meta-Analysis Results

## Study Summary 
* 64 total studies included. Within those studies, 353 phenotypes were measured for CovGE and GxE.
* 55% of all studies presented data in "means" format, whereas 45% presented raw data. 
* For CovGE, 98 phenotypes (28% of all studies) had sufficient power (> 256 total samples) as determined by simulations.
* For GxE, 157 phenotypes (44% of all studies) had sufficent power (>128 total samples) 


## Overall Patterns: 
To summarize - there are no clear patterns of CoGV or CnGV no matter which way these data are grouped.

**Caption:** These plots show the data from all 353 phenotypes measured across 63 studies. The data are the same for both plots, but the points are colored differently. In the left plot (A), points are categorized and colored based on significance as dictated by P-values. In the right plot (B), points are categorized based on significance as dictated by 95% Confidence Intervals. The simulations showed that significance based on CIs is less conservative than permutation, and these results bear that out. There are very few instances of significant CovGE based on P-values. There are several instances of significant CovGE based on CIs, though some of these may be false positives. 

Because there are more significant CovGE, I use CIs to categorize points for all plots hereafter. 

## CovGE and GxE Combined

**Caption:** Plots of CovGE and GxE divided according to Phylum. The most noticable thing is that there is a clear bias towards plants (Tracheophyta), but overall, there are no clear patterns of CovGE or GxE according to Phylum. To see whether any patterns in CovGE reveal themselves at a smaller resolution (genus level) or between endotherms and ectotherms, see the plots below. Spoiler alert, nope. (Caveat - without systematic representation from these phyla, it is hard to know whether these patterns (or the lack of pattern) are truly representative of CovGE in nature.)

**Caption:** CovGE (Note that GxE is no longer shown in this plot) organized according to Phylum and Genus.

**Caption:** Showing CovGE in Chordates only that are grouped according to whether they are endothermic or ectothermic animals.

## CovGE According to Trait Class

**Caption:** CovGE and GxE now divided according to the class of traits that each phenotype falls into. All morphological traits are now incorporated into "Size", all measures of rates (growth, o2 consumption, etc) are considered "Metabolic" traits, measures of survival or fecundity are "Fitness" traits, "phenology" are traits related to seasonal timing of life history events, "Physiology" traits are any phenotype related to maintaining homeostasis, and "Behavior" are ... behaviors. Again, slight skew of CnGV in metabolic traits, but little else (no CoGV in morphology, as was predicted by Conover et al. 2009). 


## CovGE According to Environmental Gradient

**Caption:** These are grouped according to the experimental environment to visually explore whether CnGV or CoGV are associated with the environmental gradient in focus. Water Gradient has to do with water availability, habitat type refers to more collective treatments (e.g., estuary vs. river; benthic vs. pelagic), and Physical environment characteristic has to do with some abiotic gradient that did not fit into these other categories (e.g., dissolved O2 content, pH, etc.), and biotic environment has to do with some ecological characteristic (e.g. predation, competition). Again, no strong patterns are evident here.
