These plots show the data from the 353 phenotypes measured across 63 studies. The data are the same across the two plots, but the points are colored differently. In the left plot, points are categorized based on significance as dictated by P-values. In the right plot, points are categorized based on significance as dictated by 95% Confidence Intervals. The simulations showed that significance based on CIs is less conservative than permutation, and these results bear that out. There are very few instances of significant CovGE based on P-values. There are several instances of significant CovGE based on CIs, though some of these may be false positives.
