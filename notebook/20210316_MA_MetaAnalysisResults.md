# Meta-Analysis Results

## Summary 
* 64 total studies included. Within those studies, 353 phenotypes were measured for CovGE and GxE.
* 55% of all studies presented data in "means" format, whereas 45% presented raw data. 
* For CovGE, 98 phenotypes (28%) had sufficient power (> 256 total samples) as determined by simulations.
* For GxE, 157 phenotypes (44%) had sufficent power (>128 total samples) 


## Overall Patterns:

**Caption:** These plots show the data from all 353 phenotypes measured across 63 studies. The data are the same for both plots, but the points are colored differently. In the left plot (A), points are categorized and colored based on significance as dictated by P-values. In the right plot (B), points are categorized based on significance as dictated by 95% Confidence Intervals. The simulations showed that significance based on CIs is less conservative than permutation, and these results bear that out. There are very few instances of significant CovGE based on P-values. There are several instances of significant CovGE based on CIs, though some of these may be false positives. 

Because there are more significant CovGE, I use CIs to categorize points for all plots hereafter. 

## CovGE and GxE Combined

**Caption:** Plots of CovGE and GxE divided according to Phylum. The most noticable thing is that there is a clear bias towards plants (Tracheophyta), but overall, there are no clear patterns of CovGE or GxE according to Phylum. To see whether any patterns in CovGE reveal themselves at a smaller resolution (genus level), see the plot below. Spoiler alert, nope. (Caveat - without systematic representation from these phyla, it is hard to know whether these patterns (or the lack of pattern) are truly representative of CovGE in nature.)

**Caption:** CovGE (Note that GxE is no longer shown in this plot) organized according to Phylum and Genus.
