This morning I conducted the preliminary meta-analysis literature search. 

Search parameters were: 
("phenotypic" & plast*) OR 
(gradient* & "variation") OR (phen* & "clines" OR "covariance") OR ("GxE") OR (plast* & "local adaptation")

Total Yield: 13,845 hits. 
I further refined the search to include studies that could be categorized as biological science, life science, or environmental science.

Refined Yield: 6,307. 

The records were exported in 13 csvs containing 500 literature records each, compiled in R using Metagear, and uploaded into a google drive folder for screening.

Screening criteria: 
1. Must be empirical/experimental study
2. Must include one or more of the following terms or concepts in the abstract: 
~ phenotypic plasticity (adaptive phenotypic plasticity, nonadaptive plasticity, maladaptive plasticity)
~ cogradient variation or countergradient variation
~ GxE relationship or interaction
~ phenotypic covariance, clines, variation
~ plasticity with local adaptation

Estimated Completion for Screening: 
~ Screening 100/day will take 63 days
~ Screening 250/day will take 25 days
~ Screening 300/day will take 21 days
We'll see what I rates can manage without going brain dead.

* Reminders for later: 
~ Ensure that all spelling variations are represented in data (e.g., co-gradient vs. cogradient; counter-gradient vs. countergradient)
