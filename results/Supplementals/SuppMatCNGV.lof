The black line falls along a 1:1 line while the red line reflects the pattern of the data. Point colors indicate the number of genotypes, while point shapes indicate the level of residual variation. As expected, sample estimates deviate more from the population measure in situations with low sample sizes and higher residual variation.\relax }}{5}%
