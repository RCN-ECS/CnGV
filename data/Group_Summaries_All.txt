Week   Spatial and Temporal scale of environmental variation 

Discussion Questions 
   Are marine systems more or less variable than terrestrial 

LSU 
Variability is complex  Open ocean minimal variability coastal systems have high variability  related to latitude and depth   but perhaps not as high as terrestrial 
	Open ocean   coastal ocean   terrestrial

HalDames Rule 
Water is natural buffer  so environmental variation should be greater in terrestrial systems especially at small temporal or spatial scales  Differences likely become smaller at larger spatial scales as environmental variation increase and approaches amount of variation present in terrestrial systems 

MSC 
Open ocean is temporally less variable than terrestrial  but coastal intertidal systems could be as variable or more variable than terrestrial  Spatial variation is less clear because open ocean can be highly variable in light  temperature  etc  across depths and many species  zoop up to whales  will experience this variation daily  Predictability of variation is likely higher in ocean with exception of intertidal estuarine  Wouldve like to see more data in the Steele et al  paper  

NEU 
Intuition is that marine systems are more variable  so surprised by Steeles argument based on temperature data  Marine systems are more variable given stochastic ocean currents  upwelling  offshore advection  and possibly pathogens  Intertidal should be more variable given it is subject to stressors of both marine and terrestrial environments and can vary across small spatial scales  Steele downplayed the overlap in adaptive strategies  long life  many offspring  colonial vs  social systems  between marine and terrestrial species  

UGA UNH 
Many exceptions to Steeles generalizations that they focused on specific systems to make sense of it  It is a novel idea to consider marine life history diversity as the rule  not the exception  and terrestrial environments trying to survive a much more surprising environment  Conclusion of Steele is backward from argument  as marine organisms more likely to respond with differential population expansion contraction to changing conditions  while possibly terrestrial organisms more likely to respond with plasticity  

WSU
Oceans are more variable in a greater number of conditions  oxygen availability  salinity  pH  light attenuation  substrate stability  etc   that are not considered when comparing marine and terrestrial systems  Usually these comparisons are biased toward temperature  Therefore  there may be more opportunities for selection local adaptation phenotypic plasticity to act in the marine environment that are under appreciated   

USC
Over shorter time scales  terrestrial systems are more variable  but as you increase in scale  the two systems become closer in frequency and variance of environmental change  Land is less predictable and ocean systems are more predictable  but there are many marine systems that are not predictable  Perhaps a better focus is not variability but predictability of system  Oceans are more predictable  Mobility should be considered as strategy for animals to decouple from environmental variability  More sessile marine organisms have to rely on physiological means to deal with environmental changes that occur  Factors other than environmental variability could have strong impacts on reproductive systems that develop on land  no terrestrial equivalent to marine currents so different dispersal methods evolved to respond to different environment challenge  not necessarily the variability   

RU
Agree that marine systems are generally red noise systems with variability occurring at longer time scales while terrestrial systems were generally more white noise  This is especially evident with thermal variability with marine species typically able to tolerate smaller range of temperatures than terrestrial species  with exception of intertidal species   It is difficult to categorize ocean currents as predictable sources of energy usable by dispersing larvae and argue that currents are more stochastic  especially smaller spatial scales  especially when considering the size of species impacted by those currents  Variability in the environment may act as a selective pressure  but at what level of organization does it act Individual or higher Not convinced that trees evolved longer lives as bet hedging strategy to spread out reproductive events and lessen chances of reproducing during bad period  If terrestrial systems are white noise systems  would the environment change quickly enough that organisms wouldnt have to survive for very long to move past a bad period and into a period more suitable for offspring survival Perhaps might be a better strategy to capitalize on good conditions when they occur  Also concerned with focus on invertebrate nesting as a way to mitigate environmental change  as eusociality is restricted to hymenoptera and is not dominant strategy  

FSU
Too much variability in the extent of variability within each system to draw broad conclusions about average differences  Differences in the variability and the timescales of variability between habitats and according to species experiencing environment are more informative in studying rapid adaptation  For most examples of terrestrial life history  there are marine examples  Important to be clear on difference between variability and predictability  as these aspects of environmental fluctuations are key to understanding what timescales of environmental variability means for evolution and adaptation  and maybe not for explaining differences between land and sea  The Steele paper seems to focus on parental care and predictability  that there has been more transition to high fecundity low parental care in the sea than land  Differences in parental care and other life history characteristics relates more to life in seawater vs  air  such as differences in density  viscosity  desiccation  movement  finding mates and food  etc  The trajectories of larvae in water currents are not as predictable as suggested in the paper  as currents may flow south at certain time of year but whether larvae will land in a good spot is mostly unpredictable from the parents point of view  Many biphasic marine life histories evolved to minimize the risks associated with stochastic currents  

UCONN
Steele paper argues that terrestrial systems are more variable than marine systems on thousandyear time scales  However  there are important distinctions to make especially in an evolutionary context between variability and stochasticity of a system  Unpredictable variation would have a very different effect on the evolutionary dynamics in the system compared to predictable variation  Its also unclear how well these conclusions extrapolate across latitude  would the same patterns hold for polar  temperate  and tropical systems It is important to contextualize environmental variability  For example  while relatively unpredictable current movement may increase variability at one geographic point  characteristics of the water mass itself are fairly constant  The implication therefore being that the same environmental feature might have drastically different consequences on sessile benthic organisms vs  pelagic organisms entrained within the current  

Bodega UCDavis 
Agree with Steel that small spatial scale temporal variability is more common on land than in sea due to the heat capacity of water dampening variability  However  Steele ignores or glosses over some variability in the oceans  The pelagic open ocean is subject to spatial variation in food availability  Phytoplankton are patchy and thus the pelagos isnt necessarily the constant  predictable bath favoring larval development as Steele suggests  There is also variability in the chemical characteristics of the water  salinity  pH  DO  and nutrient concentrations that can vary unpredictably on short time scales due to freshwater outflow or upwelling  Coastal regions and particularly the intertidal are much more variable than the open ocean  However  the component of this variation due to tides is predictable and that predictability changes the nature of the variability from the organisms perspective  In the water  a host is always exposed to and often in contact with potential pathogens  The microscale in the ocean might be more variable than on land  where pathogens may be selectively waterborne or passed through direct contact  Many researchers believe that marine larvae did not evolve to disperse but rather to exploit the resources and lower predator abundance of the pelagos  It could be that different life history strategies of the ocean vs  land was not driven by differences in variability but rather by differences in the physical properties of air vs  water  

UCSB UChicago 
Among the variables that are shared between terrestrial and marine systems  especially temperature  we would agree with Steele that the magnitude of variation is often greater in terrestrial systems  However  the total number of fluctuating selection pressures is likely greater in marine systems  e g   temperature  salinity  oxygen  light  pH  nutrients  etc    What are the implications of coping adapting to a greater number of fluctuating selection pressures that exhibit smaller amplitudes of variation versus coping with fewer with greater magnitude For example  in marine systems  we might expect upwelling processes to cause greater covariance in temperature  pH  oxygen  and nutrients  Therefore  while a single factor may have greater magnitude of variance in terrestrial systems  marine organisms may be more likely to experience the cooccurrence of multiple changing variables  Many studies have already recognized the importance of investigating multiple stressors within marine environments  Furthermore  the tendency for these variables to change together may result in greater predictability of the fluctuating selection pressures in marine systems  e g   in upwelling systems  organisms may predict that temperature  pH  oxygen  and nutrients will change simultaneously  Could this lead to unique optimal adaptive strategies in marine vs  terrestrial systems

  How can we link the scale of environmental variability to microgeographic adaptation in the ocean Could other mechanisms be at play 

LSU 
Linking scale of variability is dependent on what variable is being considered   Example of microgeographic Killifish populations adapting to superfund contamination  Whitehead et al      Temperature variation more difficult to link but testable in systems like intertidal zones in which selection could occur every generation and remove individuals with low tolerance to increased temp or desiccation 

HalDames Rule
Microgeographic adaptation is likely prevalent and sometimes mistaken for phenotypic plasticity  Prevalence may depend on amount of environmental variability which also varies according to scale  temporal  spatial  organizational   

When are microadaptations vs  plasticity a better strategy Benefit of each could depend on amount of variation experienced during lifetime of organism  To address this  could scale variation by lifetime to compare organisms with different life spans  Amount of variation depends on characteristics of habitat and species  Variation experienced by organism should conform to the variation of the environment if organism cannot move and is physiological conformer  Hypothesize that plastic phenotypes are more common when an organism moves relatively less but habitat varies on a temporal scale  while microadaptations are more common when organism moves less but habitat varies on spatial scale  Increases in mobility will increase plasticity relative to micro adaptations  If sea changes to become more variable through time  expect species with higher movement and higher capacity for plasticity to be more successful  

MSC 
The most critical thing in this context is environmental variability relative to dispersal and gene flow  Some mechanisms that promote or reinforce microgeographic divergence have little to do with environmental variation  Papers were disconnected because one focused on spatial variation while the other focused on temporal variation  Question claim in Steele et al  that dispersal and recruitment are predictable in marine environments  

NEU 
Better data is needed to fully understand scale of environmental variability from perspective of organism experiencing it  Most understanding of variability comes from ice cores  SST from buoys  nearshore data collected by individuals  Hard to determine microgeographic variation for many species due to logistical difficulty  Symbioses could be a mechanism that promotes microgeographic adaptation  e g  if new coral symbiont allows coral to survive in different habitat  genotype could accumulate advantageous mutations over time   

UGA UNH 
Recognition of scale  population  dispersal  symmetry  time  traits  genomic basis  needs to be more explicit in studies  Some suggest that population is a sloppy word to use in evolutionary science  Focused on examples of microhabitat variation in marine intertidal systems  Littorina saxitilis  low dispersal  strong environmental influence on shell shape and genetic composition  vs  Semibalanus balanoides  high dispersal  high environmentmediated mortality of microhabitat  no overall divergence of types   Need to think about scales important for abiotic and for the biotic  range  dispersal  abiotic variation  to be precise with contrasts  

WSU
We need a way to know what phenotypic differences are relevant in order to address what scales of environmental variability are important to look at when addressing adaptation  We cannot link them until we know how and when and where selection is acting  If selection is acting upon one life stage or stress response  other environmental variability is irrelevant  The criteria to address this question vary depending on research bias  Richardson paper accentuated the point that all potential adaptations must be evaluated under common garden conditions and across multiple generations otherwise maternal effects may be playing large role  

Richardson paper sparked conversation about how to differentiate between phenotypic plasticity and micro adaptation and in which situations either of these would be advantageous  A dimensionless gradient metric between the two could be built using specific measurements outlined in Box  of the paper  and how this could help compare species that are dissimilar in life history strategy and scale of variation they are exposed to  

USC
Marine dispersal kernels can be large  so does this mean microgeographic scales can be massive Directed dispersal would incorporate environmental variability  i e   habitat selection  at certain spatial scales  Is microgeographic variation based on genetic differences or trait differences As long as you achieve the trait with optimum fitness  then is that considered micrographic adaptation or would there have to be distinct genetic differences  how do you define local adaptation   Environmental variability would have to be on a scale smaller than the dispersal neighborhood in order to create the steep differential selection gradients needed for microgeographic adaptation  and these scales could be quite large in marine environments   Micro may be a misleading term given the dispersal range of many marine species  but adaptation is still evident over small spatial scales in marine systems even though range of gene flow is large  Does this mean that selection is increased in marine environments to produce this differentiation across smaller scales despite the high potential for gene flow Other mechanisms at play include predation  sexual selection  genotypic variation  and habitat selection which were all mentioned in the paper  

RU
Defining microgeographic adaptation in terms of dispersal ability is useful in creating a standard for comparing across systems  but the spatial scale of environmental variation may impact the likelihood degree to which microgeographic adaptation may occur  Organisms in a heterogenous environment at small spatial scales may be more likely to experience microgeographic adaptation than those that inhabit more homogenous environments given equal dispersal ability  Organisms with high dispersal ability  like pelagic larval organisms  may encounter more varied environment as they can travel larger distances  but alternatively have more gene flow across these same distances   Landscape barriers may be less likely to play a role in local adaptation in the ocean  although currents  canyons  etc  likely reduce gene flow  Finally  mechanisms like frequencydependent and spatially dependent selection might promote spatially balanced polymorphism and standing genetic variation of adaptive significance  

UCONN
Discussion focused on requirements for adaptation  For example  if oceans are less variable than terrestrial  to what degree is this reflected in the evolution of marine performance curves If this reduced temporal variability can be translated into decreased spatial variation and weaker gradients  horizontally  not with depth   this has the potential to weaken the selection needed to drive microgeographic adaptation  If marine organisms have relatively broad performance curves  the weaker environmental gradients may not represent strong enough selection to overcome migration  This reinforces that there is a significant need to characterize performance curves to diverse range of organisms before we can really define our expectations for the spatial scale of adaptation in marine systems  It is possible that narrower performance curves and increased dispersal capabilities may make microgeographic adaptation more common in marine systems  Also highlights need to understand how migration differs between marine and terrestrial systems  For planktonic organisms in the open ocean  migration is a function of mixing and dispersal  mixing = eddy diffusion  dispersal = combined effect of eddy diffusion and advection  which result in a large potential trajectories and increased potential for migration  but also behavioral regulation of position in the water column and localized circulation patterns  The classic example is planktonic crab larvae in estuarine systems which have a large potential for dispersal  but which through control their vertical position in the water column may increase local retention in the estuary resulting in a significant difference between potential and realized dispersal  Defining the allimportant dispersal kernels presents challenges for marine organisms  more for planktonic than benthic taxa  and likely relies heavily on modelling efforts  Determining an effective method of validating these modelling results is a crucial step   

A possible approach in studying this question of spatial scales in adaptation could focus on looking at intra and interestuary divergence  The strong gradients in several different environmental conditions within estuaries could facilitate reduced migration  even at small spatial scales  Salinity gradients  for example  can be very strong in estuaries  moving from fresh  low salinities to marine  saline waters over a matter of kilometers  This may help facilitate divergence over small spatial scales even in planktonic organisms  Replicating studies across estuaries could therefore be extremely useful for a myriad of questions  including investigating parallel adaptation to similar environments and how these intraestuarine gradients may facilitate interestuarine divergence and adaptation

How can microgeographic adaptation be studied in the open ocean How do you define dispersal kernels when everything  larvae and adults  is on the move Strong currents can relocate pelagic organisms over great distances  Could these species locally adapt Maybe we would be more likely to find local adaptation among retention zones like in the lee of headlands  If plankton are not caught in strong currents we might expect a gradient of allele frequencies rather than discrete subpopulations as we might expect along the coast where habitat types are patchily distributed  Selection against migrants leading to local adaptation could be especially important in the intertidal where larvae are subject to high postsettlement mortality  The evolvability of a population may depend on its adaptive genetic diversity  Individuals need to be able to acquire novel functions through genetic change that will help the organisms survive and reproduce  Further  it will depend on population size  mutation rate  sexual reproduction  and dispersal rates  Evolvability in bacteria has been shown to increase by generating more variation when populations are stressed  Large population sizes of pelagic fish increase threshold values of the selection coefficient above which selection  environmental variation  becomes an important player  Does the difference in spatial and temporal variation in the pelagic ocean compared to terrestrial systems affect the evolvability of populations living in them It probably would with regard to dispersal  modes of reproduction  and population sizes  at least  Are populations in the pelagic marine realm generally bigger than populations on land How does genetic variability compare in similar populations on land and in oceans Examples in Richardson paper were mostly about strong environmental gradients  selective pressure  caused by humans  Are there good examples of strong environmental gradients not driven by humans causing microgeographic adaptation Do humans create sharper environmental gradients than exist naturally

UCSB UChicago 
Agree that the wide dispersal distances of many marine organisms may generally suppress microscale adaptation  However  we questioned to what extent wider dispersal ranges may also increase the probability that individuals will experience an instance or instances of high selective pressure across their distribution  The model for microscale adaptation described in Richardson paper proposed microscale adaptation as a function of dispersal distance  a variable that only has a suppressive effect on adaptation  We question whether wide dispersal distances can increase the potential to interact with different selective forces  thereby amplifying the likelihood of phenotypeenvironment mismatches and signatures of adaptation  Are species with wide dispersal ranges necessarily less likely to experience microscale adaptation If not  should high potential for gene flow be reconciled with increased probability of experiencing high selective pressures when estimating occurrences of microscale adaptation



Discussion Points  Gathered by Molly  

Temporal vs  spatial variation  are they the same 

Variation in terms of predictability  what is the driver  the amplitude of variability or the stochasticity of it 

Is there difference in plasticity vs  adaptation in marine vs  terrestrial 

What governs how selection is perceived Is one strength of selection always going to produce the same fitness decline across marine terrestrial and across scales and phenotypes What might govern how selection is received

Passive vs  active dispersal  Have implications for adaptation evolution

 Week  begins January  



Week   Local Adaptation  conceptual 

What are the implications for how we individually define local adaptation on how we study it and what we think about the processes that drive it 

Penn State 
  Local adaptation is on level of demes  however many foundation fauna  grasses  corals  produce extensively via asexual reproduction whereby a particular multilocus genotype becomes locally dominant  This makes this genet particularly fit in this location and we would want to consider that local adaptation  In general  population models count individuals which can be misleading for colonial organisms and species where organismal sizes vary over a large range  
  When observing clines in gene frequency  the challenge is to understand the forces that generate the pattern  If migration is limited than differentiation in spaces is due to drift  but if there is differentiation in space despite strong gene flow it would be a strong indicator of spatially varying selection  
  Some of the most interesting case entail species that are able to maintain physiological rates across huge environmental gradients  here a nondifference in phenotypes might mask a large difference in genotypes
  Lack of theoretical treatments of the evolutionary dynamics in general and local adaptation in particular between hosts and mutualists rather than hosts and parasites  

Florida State 
  Pattern of local adaptation does not always tell us about the process or spatial scale of local adaptation  acknowledged in the paper   and that patterns of GxE for fitness  including its spatial structure  are equally interesting because of the different processes that cause it  The Blanquart et al   metric is compelling for quantifying and comparing local adaptation as a property of multiple local populations across multiple environments  The onus then is on empiricists to choose demes carefully and to interpret the metric with respect to why demes were selected and how they were sampled  especially in terms of divergent phenotypes genotypes  and the strength of divergent selection and gene flow  

Rutgers 
  Discussed how local adaptation is defined as both a pattern and as a process and how this is often confusing  As a process  what seems to be important is the relative strength of gene flow vs  selection  In cases of extensive gene flow but strong enough selection to result in balanced polymorphisms  should we call this local adaptation As a pattern  yes  As a process  no  

  Local adaptation is difficult to measure and study because nature is not in equilibrium  and that the demographics and history of natural populations matter  It is also important to have some knowledge of the spatial extent of your species in order to be able to define a deme  

  Spent time going over theory behind why few loci of large effect  vs many loci of small effect  may promote local adaptation  

  Briefly talked about how local adaptation in the ocean may be different from that on land  Besides the high potential for dispersal in the ocean  assortative mating may be more important in the ocean than currently recognized  

HalDames Rule 
  Three definitions were    Home vs  Away local adaptation is recognized by better performance  fitness  in home environments compared to other environments  comparison across location     Local vs  Foreign defined as home genotypes performing better than infiltrating genotypes  comparison within location     Sympatry vs  allopatry at metapopulation scale  performance is better on average in home locations than away locations after habitat and genetic quality effects are removed  comparing average performances   

  Comparisons are helpful descriptions of systems  but utility depends on questions being asked  Local adaptation could determine which species persist in a changing climate  So we might ask if species X show local adaptation In this question  sympatric vs  allopatric is best  Consider performance of species as whole for local adaptation  For questions about potential of maladaptation  potentially in the context of range expansion  we suggest using local vs  foreign definition  LvF seems to be more about the maladaptiveness of invading genotypes more so than local adaptation  For questions about specific subpopulations that have economic or conservation value  we suggest Home vs  Away approach  though it confounds habitat quality and local adaptation  

  For many of these definitions  there are logistical issues to consider  Maternal effects can be confounding  which can be tested in the lab  Constrains local adaptation questions to focus on shortlived or fastreproducing species that can be reared in a lab  

  None of these definitions appear to incorporate the effects of population size  which is particularly important at the margins of species range and likely also influences local adaptation  

Nicholls State 
  Common garden experiments may replace transplants when working with animals  but does not always accurately represent what happens in natural systems  

  The scale of local was the most important aspect of the definition  May not be appropriate to decide on one definition to fit all study types but maybe more appropriate to discuss scale in manuscripts  

  Plasticity and local adaptation are not mutually exclusive  Plasticity can be a trait that becomes heritable and  especially in a stochastic environment  may actually be selected for as the fittest condition  

  Issues of local adaptation specific to Louisiana were discussed Adaptation of fish and crayfish to hypoxic conditions  salt tolerant cypress trees  black mangroves along northern range edge  etc  

UMass Amherst 
  Considered local adaptation in terms of metapopulation  Both papers refer to local adaptation as a trait of a metapopulation  because in order for one deme to be locally adapted  it has to be compared to another deme  Therefore  the metapopulation itself has to be locally adapted  This seems to be slightly new to this group  since they had been thinking of local adaptation on the demelevel scale  

  A metapopulation is locally adapted when demes experience natural selection based on differences in environmental conditions  such that individuals in a specific deme experience higher fitness in their home environment  

  Kawecki et al  concluded the local vs  foreign definition is the correct one to use and this group agrees  because adaptation to anything requires present genotypes within a population or deme  Also discussed amount of genetic variation needed for local adaptation to occur  Seems there is a slim margin just enough for beneficial genotypes to be present but not enough that these genotypes get drowned out by more generalized genotypes  

  Test for higher fitness is very important to the study of local adaptation  Paper gives three methods to evaluate fitness    looking at competition between genotypes from different populations    measuring population growth rate    measurement of trait performance  Applied each of these to their own systems  found it useful in thinking about local adaptation in own systems  Survival could be tested for number   number could possibly be tested using markrecapture  but difficult to think of   number was most obvious such as growth rates  fecundity  etc  

UGA UNH 
  Best way to measure local adaptation is habitat and organism specific  Cleared up debate important distinctions in the model given habitat variability in quality as well as metrics  and between populations in terms of adapted versus plasticity etc  With fitness costs to plasticity and genomic tradeoffs being rampant  discussion centered around what systems were actually seeing local adaptation versus environmental filtering of immense amounts of genotypic diversity  thus the benefits of being marine in the Steele et al paper are that an organism can disperse huge quantities of cheap larvae and they will end up matching environmental heterogeneity with genetic heterogeneity  which is distinct from local adaptation and falls more into the microbe fungal everything is everywhere and the environment select adage  Spent time talking about reproductive waste and that local adaptation may be persistent as a pattern but not through maintaining identity by descent rather than by fortune  

Washington State 
  This group is diverse  and had diverse perspectives of selective drivers and traits  For example  localforeign evaluation is necessary for confirming local adaptation  since focal population may have similar fitness home and away  but other populations may have extremely low fitness in the local environment  

  Could it still be called local adaptation if your focal population had lower fitness overall  in context of foreign populations  but had highest fitness in home environment Considering traits that are expressed on a gradient  or a more dynamic fitness landscape  everything becomes more blurry  Does it matter whether you are better than everyone else in your environment  or just that you do best in your own environment 

  Papers did not directly consider was the impacts of competition on relative fitness  when we import populations into a focal populations environment  are we considering the effects of their interactions when evaluating fitness 

  Discussed assumption of branching phenotype and genotype and how we evaluate local adaptation  Have to be careful about how we look at phenotype and whether we actually know the underlying genetic drivers  Strictly speaking  local adaptation is on the genetic level  

  Discuss how individual definitions of phenomena often depend on how we obtain funding  and for some  a lack of clarity in fieldwide definitions can lead to questionable ethics in grant language use  Therefore  we agree that defining local adaptation  at least within this group  can benefit our efforts at large to arrive on a fieldwide consensus  

Virtual Group 
  Generally agreed that localforeign and sympatric and allopatric definitions seemed most useful  N=  sample size seemed not ideal  however N=  could refer to single plankton culture or larval culture and not the growth of one larva  

Louisiana State 
  Questions are more complicated than a simple  this is the best definition  Discussed that definition used depends on question being asked  number of demes habitats being examined  even stage of experiment  exploratory vs  secondary   Not prudent to pigeonhole into one definition  

  In every scenario  could think of home vs  away as the least useful definition of local adaptation because it does not account for either genotypic differences or habitat suitability  Also determined that local vs  foreign model is most useful when you have a few demes  When you have few demes  the use of sympatric vs  allopatric unnecessarily hides the variation  Sympatric vs  allopatric model might be useful if you are examining many demes  but in general  the sheer experimental effort required to test local adaptation thoroughly with more than  demes habitats is uncommon  Therefore  why not use local vs  foreign  

  Sketch deme example that found useful in describing why it is easier to show local adaptation via a graph rather than a quantitative value  See example and accompanying text  writing stuff wont help  

  Science community seems to be relying heavily on sequencing alone as a method for determining local adaptation  Can we truly use sequencing with no transplant to show local adaptation Does difference in genotype really matter if it doesnt correspond to increase in fitness 
  I the selection occurs at the larval stage  long before settlement  how does this impact our definition of and methods for studying local adaptation If you cannot use transplant experiments on adults  and larval phases are often still a black box  not much known   what options are there 

UC Santa Barbara 
  Myriad of implications for inconsistent definitions of local adaptation in larger ecological evolutionary framework  an impediment of metaanalyses across systems   determining generalized patterns of species adaptive capacity to climate change hinges on a unified definition of local adaptation  Local adaptation is important for RCNECU because it may allow for more resilient genotypes to persist under changing ocean conditions; demes harboring these resilient genotypes may then seed or rescue other populations in the future  Clearly defining local adaptation has salient management conservation implications  

  Kawecki et al  reserved the term local adaptation for patterns and processes observed across local populations of the same species connected  at least potentially  by dispersal and gene flow  Want to clarify that local adaptation could occur within species connected by dispersal and or gene flow  For example  sea urchin ranges in western coast  Dispersal ranges dont overlap  but there is gene flow via intermediate populations  

  Appreciating multiple models of local adaptation summarized by Kawecki and Ebert and Blanquart can improve studies of local adaptation in the context of metapopulation resilience  Application and comparison of multiple local adaptation models to a given system is necessary for    understanding complexity of dynamics occurring in multiple locally adapted demes    using studies of local adaptation to leverage conservation efforts  For example  use of homeaway or sympatricallopatric models alone to explain variation in fitness related traits across demes could ignore variation in genetic quality across them  The finding that local adaptation is nominally occurring in a species is often concluded to be evidence of its adaptive potential to environmental change  However  may not be true if a majority of demes exhibit poor genetic quality relative to a few demes that exhibit heightened fitness within their local habitat  In this case  measuring gene flow from high quality demes to low quality ones would be necessary for understanding the resilience of a metapopulation to environmental change  

  Tying local adaptation back into our discussion of ecoevolutionary processes in marine vs  terrestrial systems  we discussed how their patterns and impacts of local adaptation may vary  Wider dispersal neighborhoods and higher gene flow among marine populations may reduce the frequency of locally adapted demes  At the same time  a locally adapted deme of high genetic quality is likely to be of greater benefit to an entire metapopulations as this deme may have a wide dispersal neighborhood  facilitating the transmission of resilient genes that are capable of rescuing species  Is it possible that terrestrial systems have more frequent but weaker instances of beneficial gene flow from rescuing demes  while marine systems have less frequent but stronger instances of beneficial gene flow from rescuing demes

  Many systems do not allow for reciprocal transplant experiments  Limited to evaluating local adaptation using some combo of common garden experiments or even GxE studies that correlate fitness associated traits with environmental variables  These studies are often much more feasible and  although they may not directly measure local adaptation  give initial evidence towards demes being adapted to certain conditions 

  Also think it is important to remember that GxE interaction for FITNESS is key to defining local adaptation  For example  GxE interaction for trait such as growth  but the population may still be locally adapted because they would have higher fitness in sympatry than allopatry  In addition  many studies do not directly measure fitness and only measure traits that researchers believe to be associated with fitness  May not directly measure local adaptation  this work gives important insights for identifying populations harboring traits that correlate with certain environments  These studies become even more crucial when identifying the adaptive potential of a population to withstand future environmental conditions under climate change  

  Two limitations Blanquart paper recommends measuring more demes than individuals with the highest power coming from one individual per deme  Again  difficult to measure multiple populations and studies often can focus on a few  Also felt that one individual would bias any results about local adaptation due to that individual not representing the deme as a whole   

UC Davis 
  Two main sets of definitions for local adaptation differ in scale at which they are quantified  Local vs  foreign and Home vs away define for individual populations while Sympatric vs  allopatric is averaged across metapopulation  Which definition depends on what sort of question we are asking  

  What is important in climate change is species survival or extinction  Important when we decide what definition to use since sympatric allopatric looks at metapopulation while LF and HA look at individual populations  Local adaptation may increase diversity at metapopulation level even if local populations might go extinct during the process  The species as a whole can be repopulated by individual deme population  However  LF and HA might be more important if we were to decide on where to build marine protected area  Setting one or two definitions of local adaptation will help move the field forward by making it easier to look for broad patterns and conduct syntheses and metaanalyses  

  There are different implications whether you look at local adaptation involving single or multiple genes traits  Polygenic traits might be subject to recombination and their expression might depend on their placement in the genome  e g   linkage to other genes   This can impact the level of local adaptation and tradeoffs due to linked genes subject to opposing selection  We find it important to combine sequencing with experimental setups  

  Postsettlement mortality is important and it could drive patterns that appear to be local adaptation  Explicitly accounting for postsettlement mortality would be crucial for measuringlocal adaptationrather than other processes like environmental filtering  

  We decided that dispersal was an important feature to study regardinglocal adaptation It seems that a dispersal kernel  harkening week    of a given species needs to be defined before proceeding  In the sea  this kernel can have very long tails  In contrast  the habitat might vary at a much finer scale  Does this still lead to local adaptation Or will individuals just move instead of adapt  In panmixed metapopulation with a lot of gene flow and a large dispersal kernel  you can move through different habitats without microadaptation  Hence  we might find a mix of genotypes that is conserved across a mosaic of habitats  

  What is a population deme Could not find consensus of one definition in the ocean  In theory  populations are units that show higher levels of gene flow within than between  However  where do we set the cut of Can we split large demes into smaller demes based on location Or would we lump all demes into one that show the same sign of local adaptation Are populations in the ocean more of a continuum than distinct parts 

Matt Hare
  Blanqart paper only varied spatial heterogeneity but marine systems have a lot of temporal variability  How might that change the results of the paper Fluctuating environments may make local adaptation weaker and lower power to detectlocal adaptation 

  Struck by metapopulation perspective local adaptationis not a property of a single population  but rather of a metapopulation where multiple environments and populations are sampled  Understands general sentiment  but wouldnt we expectlocal adaptationto be stronger in some places than others If we are interested in that gradient or patchiness in evolutionary capacity or in strength of selection  then it would not be desirable to treat the metapopulation as a whole and test for local adaptation on average  Thus  agrees that working definition will depend on particular objectives  but perhaps experimental results can be presented in such a way as to allow later analysis synthesis with different objectives 

  Greatest power with one individual hard to swallow  For one  density dependence of fitness is likely to be common whereby a genotype will have different fitness if alone vs  with others  all else being equal  Do simulations reflect the enormous intrapopulation variation so often occurring within marine populations  To the extent that genotypic diversity elevates mean population fitness because of microspatial heterogeneity and microspatial GxE  the simple ways that environments were simulated could have led to a result that would not have much practical relevance  

  Spatial scales with high fecundity and broad dispersal have a lot of selection going each generation at small spatial scales relative to average dispersal distance  matchmismatch  balanced polymorphism   This is not classicallocal adaptationthat is not progressive and multigenerational but increases mean population fitness all the same  As others have noted this dynamic would generate deme differences that potentially confound and amplify patterns consistent withlocal adaptationdepending on the life stage sampled  Is it important to include adaptation from withingeneration selection into our definition of local adaptation Or control for it Or parse it out Thinks yes if we want to understand how processes affect patterns  

  We should stay anchored to motivation for studying local adaptation under increasingly rapid environmental change  We need to understand processes and mechanisms that influence the capacity for adaptive response by a population  Severe experimental constraints exist  but vital rates and population growth are what matters in ecoevolutionary dynamics and this emphasizes the need to study components of fitness across life cycle  

MSC
  Where we look forlocal adaptationin the first place depends in large part on individual definitions of local adaptation  which can make it difficult to make comparisons or general patterns  We raised several issues during course of discussion including 

  Which traits do we measure  emphasizing importance of vital rates and components of fitness  but also recognizing that bigger does not always mean better  

  How definitions oflocal adaptationmay vary across life history stages and or entire life cycle  high gene flow but strong limits on postsettlement establishment 

  The difficulty in assessing connectivity  including dispersal and actual vs  potential gene flow  between populations in marine systems and how this may affect predictions and interpretations given that restricted gene flow is expected

  The role of abiotic vs  biotic factors inlocal adaptation Biotic is not often couched aslocal adaptation the way reciprocal transplant experiments are done may minimize or eliminate effects of the biotic environment  Biotic interactions may result in more temporally variable selection  which may require consequent changes in dispersal and gene flow to detect LA

Cal State Monterey Bay 
  Discussed merits of studying traits vs  fitness and common garden vs  reciprocal transplant experiments  Some definitions oflocal adaptationwere difficult to assess  There was nostalgic affinity for home vs  away definition  though shortcomings were recognized  Reflected overall tension in group about the merits of theoretical consideration  but the challenges in assessing them in marine systems  

  Scale not a big point of concern as most agreed thatlocal adaptationwould be variable depending on scale and system and question people were asking  

  Temporal variation and its possible effect on local adaptation was discussed  Generally favored the sympatryallopatry definition based on it being more explicit as a model  but in hindsight  could have spent more time debating whether it was sufficient than just the best of the three  If temporal flux could be encompassed into either habitat or deme effects  it might not be that big of a deal  There are likely cases in which the assessment of plasticity evolving as a response to temporal fluctuation could be explored as another means of further isolating the effect of local adaptation  

Cornell 
  Most agreed that it is more intuitive and meaningful to think about whether specific populations  rather than every single deme within a meta population  is adapted to local conditions  Seems likely that for a species distributed over a vast range of environmental conditions  we might expectlocal adaptationin the extreme habitat conditions  but not necessarily in more intermediate ones  If strictly applying SA concept  might in such a case conclude that the species does not show local adaptation  which would be misleading  

  Questioned general value of knowing whether species showslocal adaptationor not  Fitness discussed in theoretical terms  while of course the practical reality is that fitness is hard to measure  Even if we could measure fitness perfectly  how much insight would we gain from knowing that a species showslocal adaptationif we dont know the particular mechanisms or traits through which this local adaptation is conferred 

  It is important to study putative fitness traits  but also gain an understanding of what different traits and tradeoffs are involved in the adaptation and how each of these traits interact to influence fitness  

  We can use insights aboutlocal adaptationto predict responses to climate change and other rapid environmental shifts  Seems thatlocal adaptationwithin a species could both hinder and promote adaptive responses  If populations are closely adapted to current local environment  they may not be able to respond quickly enough to change  In that sense  a really resilient generalist population may fare much better local adaptationcould be disadvantageous   Conversely  having a diverse set of populations preadapted to many different environmental conditions could also seed rapid adaption in a changing environment  or if the species is mobile  can facilitate spatial reorganization of genotypeenvironment matches  

  Provoked by suggestion in Blanqart to do single individuals  Beyond obvious logistical challenges  discussion pros and cons of design  None could think of a study that used this approach  


What definition of local adaptation should we  the RCNECS  network use

Penn State 
  Using mathematical notation  HA and LF was an improvement over the first paper
  Recognize issues marine field has with measuring fitness and particularly agreed with reminder that bigger is not always better


Florida State 
  No consensus reached  Presence of dispersal between demes seems to always raise discussion and different perspectives on what is and is not local adaptation  For example  it is often noted that a balanced polymorphism  where there is high dispersal and where genetic differentiation is maintained by strong postsettlement selection against migrants acting each generation after dispersal  is not local adaptation  but could still give rise to a pattern of local adaptation  

  However  another perspective is that the sorting of genotypes after settlement still effectively reduces gene flow  and could still lead to the evolution of local adaptation if there is enough local retention for persistence and subsequent build up of locally adapted alleles  The proportion of recruits that are immigrants vs  local origin at the scale being studied  seems relevant  

  Recommend Conover et al  for when transplant experiments are not feasible 

Rutgers 
  Local adaptation is challenging to define because it depends on your system and how local is local  Our working definition has three criteria    phenotype needs to be heritable    phenotype needs to influence fitness    GxE interaction within habitat range that is possible from dispersal over multiple generations  Many processes could result in patterns of local adaptation  

HalDames Rule 
  Generally  for synthesizing data  the best way to ascertain species level adaptation effects was to utilize the approach laid out by Blanquart et al  isolating local adaptation effects from genetic or habitat quality effects  Orthogonal reciprocal transplant studies can be turned into allopatric vs  sympatric comparisons  and we can potentially combine studies of different  putatively connected populations to parse together a metapopulation to ask broad questions if data within a study is sparse  

Nicholls State 
  Defining terms narrowly may be a hindrance to good science  Design of local adaptation studies may vary drastically when the environment varies drastically  coastal CA vs  coastallocal adaptation  

Washington State 
  Long discussion of metaphors in science  Big umbrella terms are metaphors because they are used by a wide variety of people for different reasons  making our work more connective and approachable  theoretically   When we try to define metaphors  however  groups of people separate out with different definitions and metaphor no longer holds same strength across field  Group did not agree on whether metaphors should be strictly defined or left open  as long as they are accompanied by definitions  
  To make a definition  have to realize it is more important to exclude than include things  To do this  we have to agree on whether local adaptation is a property of the metapopulation or the deme  Is something locally adapted or is local adaptation happening What is our evolutionary unit Who is selection acting upon We would argue that selection is acting upon We would argue that selection is acting up the population level in our definition  it has to be for W between different populations  
  Why would anyone care about the metapopulation We disagree that metapopulation is a part of the definition of local adaptation  We study local adaptation in the context of demes and focal populations  what happens to other populations is somewhat irrelevant  We still need perspectives from the homeaway and local foreign perspectives  but local adaptation as a property of the metapopulation is not necessarily relevant to focal populations that have lower fitness in their own and other habitats  
  Take home perspective is important  Sympatricallopatric perspective is just rebranding of homeaway but just controlling for habitat quality  We care about story of one population  which means that homeaway is the best metric  However  need to know the context of other habitat quality  and therefore localforeign is needed to be able to say a population is better in their home environment and others do in that same space  
  When you think you have a locally adapted population but dont see a home vs  away differences because of limitations on measurements  we need extra inference from the localforeign population  
  Argue for using more than one individual per population  which is obvious inclusion when you consider on the population instead of the metapopulation level  
  When measuring local adaptation  focus should be on repeatability of evolving those specific traits and think carefully about complex vs  mendelian traits  
  Thought process on defining local adaptation must be strict in considering which drivers of selection we consider  and how we incorporate  or not  potential interactions into the habitat variable 

Virtual Group 
  Emphasized importance of understanding local adaptation as process  not just a pattern  However  the definition will depend on the question and should account for local adaptation in time  seasonal changes in phytoplankton   the role of postsettlement selection local adaptationisnt happening if panmixia occurs in gametes larvae every generation  but if only adults are sampled  could easily look likelocal adaptation pattern   The importance of genetic structure  though postsettlement selection can lead to genetic structure in sampled adults withoutlocal adaptation  The importance of scale and patchiness of habitat  how do the definitions and practicalities of measuringlocal adaptationchange if you are considering patches vs  different ends of a cline  

  A flow chart might be a convenient way to summarize the best way to test for local adaptation given the particularities of the system at hand  

  How to test forlocal adaptationDiscussed it can be unethical to do transplants if there will be gene flow into surrounding populations  particularly a concern for open systems  But  lab studies have obvious drawbacks discussed in readings  Also talked about role of molecular studies  which has changed a lot since  

Northeastern 
  First thought to begin definition of local adaptation as needing genetic component but found in discussions that genetic component may not always be detectable  especially when many loci of small effect are responsible for a given phenotype and these may not be detectable by current statistical models  In addition  current literature around epigenetic shows epigenetic modifications do not change the underlying code but are heritable and potentially increases the fitness of offspring in a given environment  Therefore  if we cannot detect a genetic component to phenotypic differences when placed in different habitats can we not call that local adaptation 

  Rather discuss when home vs away or local vs foreign would be appropriate and or useful ways of truly identifying local adaptation  Each definition is useful in its own right and can provide useful information  For example  the home vs  away comparison tells if deme is currently located in a habitat in which it displays highest fitness compared to other habitats  We could not conclude that a population is locally adapted in its home environment from this comparison  A deme may have highest fitness in its home habitat when comparing across habitats  but other allopatric demes may have higher fitness and be more adapted to that focal demes habitat  This comparison still gives important information about adaption in the focal deme and where it may survive and persist but may not always identify local adaptation  

  Local vs  foreign definition instead can tell us if the sympatric deme is more fit in the environment in which they are found when compared to all other allopatric demes  This can more often identify local adaptation because comparing a focal  sympatric deme to all other demes in the study and identifying the deme with the highest fitness  Again  able to think of scenarios which we would not detect local adaptation using this method  such as populations undergoing selection or historic bottlenecks 

UC Davis 
  We think one definition may not suffice  Since SA definition operates at the level of metapopulation and LF is best at the level of the deme  they can be used to address different questions depending on the scale of interest  Maybe best to calculate both metrics but rely on the definition that fits the study question  However  uses of the LF or HA should address their limitations  deme quality and habitat quality should be recorded quantified   

MSC 
  There is value in considering multiple metrics oflocal adaptationand thus found it difficult to choose one  SA lacks power to test a number of experimental designs that might provide valuable info onlocal adaptationat population scale  Being able to make pairwise comparisons can be valuable and informative  as opposed to thinking only at a metapopulation scale   Similarly  being able to assess patterns at a population level is sometimes necessary as we seek to understand and predict the effects of climate change  but this isnt possible using only the SA approach given the focus on average performance at the metapopulation scale  Additionally  SA approach doesnt account for mortality  so how often this approach has been successfully applied in marine systems and how often mortality  and other realities of experimental manipulations  hindered applications of SA approach  

Questions 

It is important for RCN to come to consensus on language referring to the study of local adaptation  
   Agree
   Disagree

Local adaptation is not a property of a single population but a property of metapopulation  
    Agree
   Disagree
When studying local adaptation  the deme is the relevant unit of biological replication and more than  demes should be studied  
    Agree
   Question Mark
  Some discussion over what a deme is  but overall  none disagree  

A GxE interaction is a prerequisite for local adaptation  
   Agree
   Disagree

Local adaptation cannot be determined from a single population transplanted across multiple environments  Nor can it be determined by multiple populations grown in the same single environment location  
    Agree
    Disagree
  One comment advising caution against using absolutist language or drawing lines in sand 

It is inappropriate to say population deme X is locally adapted to environment Y because of the metapopulation context of local adaptation it implies something about the fitness of other populations in that environment  Instead it would be more accurate to say  population deme X has evolved via natural selection to environment Y
   Agree
   Disagree
   Do not know
    comment suggesting that it depends on why you want to know about population x  

We should be careful to use language that distinguishes between the extent of local adaptation of a metapopulation  the extent to which a deme has evolved  including processes of selection  mutation  drift  and gene flow  in response to local conditions and the extent to which that evolution is due to evolution by natural selection  
    Agree
   Disagree

The RCN should use the quantitative metric proposed and sympatric allopatric statistical test by Blanquart et al to measure the extent of local adaptation of a metapopulation 
   Agree
   Disagree
   Unsure

We need to come to a consensus on quantitative metrics that can be used to measure the extent to which a deme has adapted to local conditions  
   Agree
   Disagree

The RCN should use one of the three definitions proposed in the Blanquart paper Quantitative definition    a quantification of the proportion of spatial variation in mean fitness caused by adaptation to local conditions in a metapopulation  Quantitative definition   the difference between fitness of populations in sympatry  eg transplanted back where they came from  and populations in allopatry  transplanted somewhere else   Quantitative definition   the component of GxE interaction explained by sympatric vs  allopatric contrast  
   Agree
   express concerns that if we use this definition  previously published examples of local adaptation will no longer qualify as examples of local adaptation  

The definition of local adaptation that should be used is context dependent  
   agree
   disagree

Week   Local Adaptation  in practice

    When does landscape genomic data present good evidence of local adaptation  without experiments  

Rutgers 
  If local adaptation is a measurable increase in fitness  then no  Genomics in this sense cant present conclusive evidence oflocal adaptation No quantitative measure of fitness based only on genetic differences  
  The question was raised whether you could have these genomic signals favoring spatially divergent selection when nolocal adaptationis happening  A few examples of alternative explanations included allelesurfing and other genetic drift  error  and nonrandom mating  Matting success is part of a phenotype  even if it depends on the organisms social environment  
  We ended up back at Ks statement that phenotype has too many dimensions to quantify in the same way as genomics  Genomics and transplants together  when appropriate for the same organism  highlight the genetic as well as phenotypic mechanisms behind apparent local adaptation  

Univ  Southern California 
  In an ideal scenario  such a study system has welldefined drivers for local adaptation  such as thermal cline of Australian Drosophila  In cases with well annotated genomes and large effective populations sizes  markers that strongly deviate from expected genetic variability offer a suite of potential regions under selection  
  Careful consideration of the ecologically relevant factors that may drive local adaptation and how an organism would account for deviations in factors physiologically can be used as a guide when analyzing genomic data from spatial regions in whichlocal adaptationmay have occurred  A strong understanding of the potential selective pressures and how they could be solved genetically would be the strongest evidence for local adaptation  
  In the absence of this knowledge  we should be wary about constructing just so statements from genomic regions that segregate with each population  By integrating previous experimental data  and or indepth knowledge of the study system landscape genomic data can be used to generate and test hypotheses  Unfortunately  most study systems do not allow for genetic manipulation of candidate genes to assess functionality or the impact on fitness  

CSU Northridge 
  Not too many cases where genomic data can present good evidence for local adaptation  
  Two instances they came up with were when landscape genomic data could contribute evidence to  but not necessarily result in proof  of local adaptation would be if    These data were paired with environmental parameters that you could attribute to changes in genomic data  or   Identifying the phenotypes of genes that were different  
  Found fly paper interesting but failed to see how the authors concluded that there were fundamental biological differences between flies from these two geographic regions 

Virtual Group
  Most genomic data alone do not provide much evidence of local adaptation  though if there are very strong signals of selection  perhaps this could be suggestive  However  gene by environment interactions are the exception to this and are fairly compelling in identifying loci that are likely under selection due to the environment  so parallel mechanisms of local adaptation   
  Conclusion that integration of ecological experimental approaches is best  Doesnt make sense to do a bunch of sequencing if there is no evidence of interesting biology  The fly paper falls into this category in that a ton of work has been done indicating there is adaptation to temperature  the genomic follow up is a logical next step to get at mechanism 

Washington State U 
  Never  We need an assay of fitness  ecological context  to provide proof that differences at the genetic level actually manifest at the phenotypic level  where selection is acting  
  Also depends on your audience how important this is  but generally we expect some tie to fitness to be able to say something about local adaptation if it can be mapped to specific coding sequences  but thats making assumptions about how selection works 
  Sometimes fine that even the most indepth sequencing doesnt provide with nucleotide that matters  especially in complex traits and environments  There are multiple ways to arrive at certain phenotypes on the genotype level  so it can be difficult to discern local adaptation even for a relatively simple phenotype or trait  Using just genetic sequencing  especially when we dont have adequate knowledge of function  it is very difficult to label local adaptation for complex traits  

Northeastern MSC
  Agreed that landscape genomics approach can provide good insight into novel system that perhaps does not have much a priori information  
  However  in the full absence of manipulative experimental procedure it generally should be relied upon more to provide indicators of local adaptation  as opposed to providing more conclusive evidence of it  
  With regard to local adaptation it is not enough to know an alleles effect on a trait  but also that traits effect on fitness  

Bodega UC Davis UC Santa Cruz 
  Can present good evidence if you have several replicates of the same environmental cline and populations showing the same direction of allele frequency changes  However it will always be a correlation and not fully sufficient to demonstrate local adaptation  
  Comparison of various genomic metrics between populations can also provide insight into past selection  drift  or other demographic phenomena  e g   using patterns of allelic diversity to infer selective sweeps   
  Economic motivation for comparing only the two endpoints of the drosophila range are understandable  we thought the study would benefit from the inclusion of an intermediate population to verify the progressive nature of allele frequency changes with latitude as opposed to geographic breaks  

Nicholls State 
  Genomic data provide valuable insights  specifically when researchers can link the genetics to the phenotype  Stronger cases can be made when additional data like transcriptomics  epigenomics  and proteomics  Pairing a study using multiple data types with experiments makes an even stronger case  
  We dont believe that the discussion should be genomics or experiments  The question of local adaptation is too big to only use one tool  We should employ all tools when appropriate  which may vary based on the question  basic vs  applied science   the system  the scale  the organism  etc  
  When working with nonmodel and longlived species  genomics can provide a good starting point to design an integrative approach to local adaptation  

UMass Amherst 
  Reminded that this is model based evaluation of adaptation  in which theory is used to describe what adaptation would look like  then actual genomes are examined for that pattern  
  Advantage of genomic approach is that markers of selection can be examined without phenotypes of selection  Also the direction of functional gain rather than neutral loss can be evaluated  
  Downside is that this approach requires good quality genomes to align reads against  which are not available for all organisms  Furthermore  deep insights and direct demonstration into what exactly the functional genes differing between organisms may do with respect to local adaptation is for the most part limited to model organisms and relatives  

UConn UT Arlington 
  Phenotype is needed when analyzing genetic data  Therefore  experimentation is necessary at some point  especially because we cant support that variances are due to selection and not drift without experimentation  
  If experimentation isnt going to be carried out in a specific study  there would need to be very strong a priori information about fitness dynamics surrounding local adaptation  
  Felt that papers provided good general methods pipelines as Snail paper establishes that local adaptation exists within a species while the Fly paper seeks to explore the genetic basis for that adaptation  

Old Dominion 
  Depends on study system  which usually requires a biotic or abiotic gradient between populations that can produce differences in fitness such as temperature or prey availability  
  Also depends on which genes are under selection and the genomic techniques used to analyze local adaptation  For example  structural changes in genomic data can indicate divergence under environmental selection  
  Genomeenvironmental association analyses  GEAA  have become important for studies of local adaptation which are sensitive to gene variants associated with various environmental parameters  It is important to incorporate analysis of neutral genetic structure in studies of local adaptation as well  

Cornell
  Highly dependent on study system  if good evidence of local adaptation can be presented without experiments and is dependent on conclusively linking genomic changes to phenotypic changes 
  Not always possible for nonmodel systems for which we dont know much about the functions of genes  
  However  if one can link genetic variation to phenotypic variation  particularly in populations along an environmental cline or across parallel cases of adaptation  then genomic data can provide good suggestive evidence of local adaptation  
  Genetic data are therefore most meaningful in the context of phenotypic information  
  Also discuss whether this would be conclusive proof for local adaptation since one wouldnt know if these genetic changes really lead to higher fitness or not  
  In order to show local adaptation  one has to perform experiments  
  Even without experiments  genomic data can provide useful insights into the potential phenotypes under selection and thus provide a very good basis for experimental test of local adaptation  Experiments cannot be performed for many species  and genomic analyses can be the best evidence of local adaptation in these species  

UConn Marine Science 
  Landscape genomic data are useful in forming hypotheses about local adaptation  but insufficient to test for it  
  Not enough to determine how selection may be influencing certain genets  especially in nonmodel organisms without robust annotation or mapping data  
  Should be cautious in interpreting genomic differentiation if we are unsure of how those signatures relate to the environment  

UC Santa Barbara
  Genomic data can suggest that local adaptation is occurring  but is not indicative of the degree to which fitness is changing  when genetic drift is controlled for  
  Changes in allele frequencies that are evident after controlling for genetic drift may be a smoking gun for selection on fitnessrelated traits  That said  measuring gene flow and or dispersion is necessary for understanding genetic drift and therefore we agree that sequence data is not useful in this context purely on its own  

UC Merced
  Landscape genomic data  such as differential population genetics and Fst values  is not sufficient for supporting local adaptation because of the difficulty in excluding other potential causes of differentiation  
  Genomic data may be more useful in assessing locally adapted alleles in high dispersing  well mixed populations  problem may be cryptic species   

Northeastern 
  Discussed that genomic data is more convincing when it is paired with experimental data  and evidence can be further improved by pairing it with clear morphological and environmental differences  For example  genetic loci putatively linked to selection along a gradient that also tracks changes in phenotypes along the same hypothesized selective gradient could be taken  in tandem  as good evidence of local adaptation  
  Acknowledge that this scenario would likely contribute to a bias towards genes of large effect  
  Also  genomic data linked to genes that implicate differences in fitness along this gradient could represent a compelling case for local adaptation  although identifying such links  functional pathways  requires that sufficient annotations be available for the species of interest  
  A particular shortcoming of the Fly study was its reliance on only the temperature cline endpoints  without any genomic data from the middle of the temperature range  Without a more complete characterization of genomic data along the temperature cline  it is difficult to make conclusions about local adaptation  

Louisiana State 
  Although genomic data may provide evidence for local adaptation  generally agreed that genomic data alone are insufficient for concluding that local adaptation has taken place  Differential genotypes do not necessarily indicate differential fitness and may not be result of adaptive processes  
  All available data should be included and used for comparison against a null model  which could be used to predict the selection necessary to establish the difference among genotypes  The fly study couldve used a null model to predict the selection that wouldve been necessary to establish the cline and compared genomic data against the model  
  It is methodologically problematic to select the     and  outliers and consider them as a priori differentiated since there will always be outliers  yet they may not be significant for detecting local adaptation  If the outliers are always considered differentiated  and if differentiation is evidence for local adaptation  then by definition there will always be evidence for local adaptation  
  Instead  genes with known phenotypic correlates should be chosen for analyzing whether or not their differential distribution along a cline is adaptively significant  
  By limiting the Fst windows to  kb gradual adaptation driven by weak selection involving larger sections of the genome may be missed  A SNP analysis may provide additional insight  but in the absence of knowledge about the fitness differences of different genotypes  a genomic analysis alone is unable to conclusively demonstrate the presence of local adaptation  

CSU Monterey Bay 
  Landscape genomic approaches are most relevant for exploring genetic mechanisms that might underlie local adaptation  Evidence that landscape genomics is largely context dependent  
  What lead to these studies to have such compelling arguments for local adaptation was that in both cases there was a context where local adaptation made compelling sense  Possible adaptation had been established in the snail before transplant experiments and their dispersal capability is already somewhat limited as compared to other marine species and there had already been work on Drosophila in Australia to suggest genetic clines or patterns of local adaptation  
  It was pointed out that neither of these studies demonstrated local adaptation as described by Week s papers  neither paper well demonstrated local adaptation  In snail study  you had one population outperforming the other in multiple environments and in neither did they test for actual fitness  

Univ  Queensland 
  Landscape genomics provides good evidence for local adaptation if the study is replicated across multiple landscapes of the same environmental gradient  If such replication recovers the same set of loci  then it might support the idea of the local adaptation  
  But recovering same loci across replicates will not reject local adaptation caused by similar factors  Because landscape genomics is correlative in nature  we think that inferring the particular causative factor is difficult even in well replicated study  
  Similarly  using the genomic information to identify cellular physiological processes that are likely to be influenced by environmental factor of interest might post challenges as well due to the possible links of many cellular  metabolic physiological  pathways  

   How do the different research approaches  experimental vs  genomic  give different insights 

Rutgers 
  Experimental approach allowed the identification and manipulation of selective pressures in a nonlaboratory experiment  The group behind the whelk study has an incredibly detailed understanding of their study system  and between the foundations placed by their previous work and the differences in fitness of local and distant phenotypes in CA plots  they make a strong case for the existence and drivers of local adaptation in this species  
  This approach does not  however  reveal the genetic mechanisms behind the drilling adaptations of the California snails  If researchers used a genomics approach on this species without the same system knowledge  they may find plenty of positively selected genetic differences  but they may attribute them to the climatic gradient between CA and WA rather than to differences in prey recruitment  
  Genomics approach can be used to look for genetic differences relatively quickly and to avoid the confounding effects of plasticity and maternal effects  But you need the resources  annotated genomes  to know that the outliers they find are likely to result in phenotypic difference 
  In addition  this approach gives a deep time perspective that is impossible to achieve with transplant experiments  These genetic differences integrate over all past conditions and over whatever factors you didnt measure in the field  
  You can look at a broader scale of genetic change without examining specific drivers or phenotypic mechanisms  but you still get very detailed information on the mechanisms of genetic change  

Univ  Southern California 
  Experimental approaches offer the ability to use a topdown method of hypothesis testing by manipulating specific ecological parameters of interest while still maintaining the complex environment available in situ that would be difficult to recapitulate in a lab setting  
  Genomic data employs a bottom up approach and allows for tracking of genetic information as the currency of evolution to ascertain if noted phenotypic differences appear in association with particular genotypes  
  Genomic information may also be acquired from a broad scale of organisms without direct manipulation in the field and such data is often relatively simple to generate and maintain  all the while knowing that it reflects the objective genetic character of natural populations  assuming adequate sampling   
  Coupling of the two approaches has the greatest potential to map ecologically applicable characteristics of the organism and their genotype to measurements of fitness to determine the validity of local adaptation in the system  

William and Mary 
  Question how much training across subdisciplines in biology matters here  If intro to adaptation is largely genomic bioinformatic vs  natural historical  how does that drive the types of questions youre asking 

  Both can be compelling but how do we bridge gap in training for students to appreciate and become adept at both if both are necessary 

CSU Northridge 
  After significant debate  concluded that experimental approaches provide ecologicallyrelevant insights into tangible implications such as management in response to changing environmental conditions  whereas genomic approaches give insights into detailed mechanistic aspects of adaptation  
  From experimental design standpoint  talked a lot about how to design experiments from both aspects that would target question of adaptation  and came to consensus that if the system was well studied  an experimental approach with targeted genomic data would be able to pinpoint both adaptation as well as mechanisms  However  if not much was known about a system  perhaps a shotgun approach of looking at a landscape genomic changes could be a good place to identify genes of interest then design ecological experiments around this  
  Also discussed  if we need genomic data to determine adaptation  If certain trait was being selected for and was identified  genetic data could provide a mechanistic cause  but perhaps would not be needed to prove adaptation  

HalDames Rule 
  There are merits of incorporating both methods  Reciprocal transplant experiments can identify fitness differences which could show local adaptation  but genomic data is needed to show there is a genetic basis for the differences  
  For genomic studies  positive selection can be evaluated  but it does not necessarily mean the selected phenotypes are habitat specific; reciprocal transplant experiments are needed to evaluate habitat specificity  
  Alternatively  experiments are not always possible  and genomic studies can be insightful on their own if there are apriori expectations of the region of the genome to target; candidate genes associated with traits expected to be under selection  complementary expression and trait data  and or clear phenotypic differences  
  For snails and flies  it is important to distinguish local adaptation from neutral processes like drift  Also  corridors connect subpopulations of both species  For flies  wind currents  human aided dispersal  and active flying and their range have the possibility of connecting the different populations  For the Snails  their movement across sites is primarily due to dispersal during the larval stage  so retention of larvae at a local site is needed to maintain adaptations 
  Comparing the two papers  the flies were also likely somewhat domesticated which can affect inference of what genes may be under selection  

Virtual Group
  Think experimental work largely identifies patterns  local adaptation  while genomics gets us to the mechanism  Experimental work is fundamentally important to understand the drivers behind different performance of populations and which selective pressure may be driving adaptation  Genomics provides a nice way to identify the genes mechanisms that may be responding to this selection  
  The issue with selection scans alone is linking the genotype to the phenotype that may be under selection  and how to avoid story telling with the results  
  Because environments are complex  it is unlikely that all selected regions are linked to temperature tolerance  or whatever trait   so parsing down the many regions identified as under selection to the set that drive temperature tolerance is important 
  One strategy is to use association mapping to link genotype to phenotype while simultaneously using selection scans  Then you can look for regions under selection that explain phenotypic variation in whatever trait  

Washington State U 
  The inference result per dollar in these types of datasets are very different  Also  there are some systems where one or the other approach is not feasible  long generation times   
  Best and cheapest way to make inferences about local adaptation  if animal is tractable  is experimental approaches  But most cant be investigated this way  
  If experiments arent feasible  you may need to make genetic correlations with environment  We do like that the genomic approach gives historical context but cant say for sure whether this is specifically due to local adaptation 
  Lots of discussion around how value of insight between two approaches is organismspecific

  Experimental approaches seemed to us to be the basis of all studies aiming for insights into fitness  which we agreed should be a focal point in any discussion of local adaptation  But additionally  experimental studies have the advantage of allowing for questions ranging from the limits of endurance to extreme values of environmental factors or identifying instances of phenotypic plasticity  
  Genomic approaches allow for broader evolutionary considerations  and in some ways can be necessary to perform prior to other experimental work in order to establish proper population structure or establishing genotypephenotypeecotype relationships and considering multivariate interactions between environmental variables in GxE studies  

Bodega UC Davis UC Santa Cruz 
  Experimental studies common garden and reciprocal transplant experiments like Snail study provide strong evidence of fitness differences between demes  and are useful in making informed conclusions about the ecological effects of these fitness differences  In other words  they make possible the empirical leap from evolutionary to ecological processes  However  they provide very little insight into the direct mechanisms of selection  
  Genomic studies Assist in building hypotheses for candidate genes and the physiological mechanisms through which adaptation may occur  and also provide a genetic context for understanding the present and historical constraints on local adaptation like gene flow  linkage  and genetic architecture  but are correlative and cant directly measure differential fitness  
  Component missing from both is the physiological link from genetics and expression to ecology  what is happening in different tissues and how is it happening They attack question from both sides but did not converge in the middle  

Nicholls State 
  Experimental approach was more elegant and the researchers were able to tie the information directly into the ecology of the system  However the experimental approaches do not provide insight into mechanism  Conversely  genomic studies provide info on a mechanism  but sometimes we struggle to connect that to the ecology 
  Fruit fly paper provided a wealth of data on the pathways potentially affected by genomic differences  which is valuable information and definitely shows more work should be done along this cline  
  Work with model organisms can lay groundwork to do more with nonmodel organisms  but this kind of study would not be possible with many other organisms  
  With right study design  molecular work can be used to understand how plastic an organism is  which may be more difficult with experimental approaches  
  Epigenomics proteomics transcriptomics combined with modeling can provide estimates of how well a population may acclimate adapt in a changing environment  May also be less invasive especially if working with endangered animal  
  Using both together is most powerful way than either by itself  

UMass Amherst 
  Wondered about F generations  How do we avoid biasing the response of different populations when we transplant them out into the field by selecting a common lab environment 
  Why f and not f Just because everyone does it 
  How do we balance adaptation in the lab with too many generations vs  not enough to remove maternal effects What if maternal effects are the adaptation 
  Genomics offers evolutionary directionality  hypothesis generation  and looking at mechanisms  The transplant approach offers testing of specific hypotheses  results of adaptation phenotypes  and use of nonmodel organisms in complex environments they evolved in  

Old Dominion 
  The best approach depends on study system and study species  Fly paper was able to measure a swath of genomic indices that could indicate adaptation or divergence in part because the whole genome of D  melanogaster has been sequenced  making it a great candidate species  
  Experimental studies can observe how or if genetic differences show up in the study system  but it is important to understand the functional properties of the genes under selection  Measuring regulatory elements can provide information about the pathways that are under selection and gene knockouts can determine the functionality of genes supposedly responsible for local adaptation  
  Important for collaboration between different but complementary disciplines to emphasize effects of genetic changes on local adaptation  

Cornell
  Experimental and genomic approaches give insights into different aspects of local adaptation and therefore the integration of both is very powerful  
  While experimental approaches  common garden  or reciprocal transplant experiments can teach us a lot about differences in fitness  the role of divergent phenotypes and the drivers of selective agents  they dont provide insight into the genetic mechanisms of local adaptation and are often not feasible  
  The experimental snail study does a neat job of showing that fitness differs between populations but falls short of its potential as they did not further explore potential phenotypic differences between populations 
  Linking such an experimental study with landscape genomic analyses  particularly along the entire cline  could however provide more insights into the processes and mechanisms of local adaptation  such as the migrationselection balance and identifying genes underlying adaptive phenotypes  
  We think one approach should be followed up by the other  order unimportant  if one wants to provide evidence of local adaptation  Genomic approaches could first provide insights into mechanisms and potential phenotypes under selection  which are then tested through experiments  or experimental approaches can reveal the presence of local adaptation and identify adaptive phenotypes  and genomic approaches could be then used to investigate the underlying proximate and ultimate mechanisms of adaptation 

UConn Marine Science 
  Experiments test for local adaptation  genomics informs on mechanisms of adaptation  Both techniques must be executed in tandem and used to corroborate each other when assessing for mechanisms of adaptation 
  Must use experimental approaches to assess what traits are affected under certain environments  and must use genomics to understand how these traits are changing  
  Can also be subject to organism habitat in question  which may help decide what analysis will produce the most impactful result  

UC Santa Barbara
  Many of the major differences have already been brought up  transplantation studies provide quantitative insights into fitness differences  genomic approaches generate hypotheses about mechanisms of adaptation and they agree that integration of both approaches is ideal  
  Proposed following experimental design and wondered what info you could pull from this that you cant determine using either on its own Rear F hybrids of different demes under common garden conditions  outplant the F hybrids to home and away habitats where you measure fitness related traits in a large sample size of identifiable individuals and measure qtl associated with variation in fitness between both demes  
  If you could pull this off  you could understand what proportion of genetic divergence between demes is due to hybrid breakdown  which could be important in evaluating a high quality demes ability to rescue demes that are at risk  
  Limitations in this are fairly serious and we wondered to what extent this experiment would be possible in model marine systems   

UC Merced
  Genomic and experimental research approaches can both show inherent population difference  but genomic approaches produce more mechanistic results  whereas ecological experimental approaches can give more general holistic patterns  
  Linked to the aspect of scale incorporated in genomic and experimental approaches  For example  genomics provides smaller scaled insight for specific genes  while field experimentation can branch out showing organismal interactions and patterns in ecosystems  This suggests that both approaches are valid but become more useful when combined  

Northeastern 
  Genomic approaches can give insight into genetic differences  but not necessarily  directly  get at the agents of selection that are driving them  With experimental approaches  you can test hypothesized agents of selection  
  In general  genomic approaches may be more useful when an annotated genome is available for the organism of interest  as a way to make indirect inferences about function  which may limit the applicability of these approaches to nonmodel organisms  
  Spatial scope of inference is potentially much broader when using genomic techniques than that which is feasible through experiments  However  if the aim is to make associations between genetic and environmental differences across space  genome scan approaches would also require finescale characterization of the environment  
  Experimental approaches  alternatively  provide direct framework with which to test agents of selection  but require that the experimenter make a choice about the selective agent to test and the appropriate response variables to measure  
  A strength of experimental approaches like reciprocal transplant is that they often allow direct measurement of fitness  or traits that affect fitness  whereas a link to the relevant traits and organismal fitness is often missing from a purely genomic approach  even for those with well annotated genomes  

Louisiana State 
  Genomic approaches provide insight into allele frequency changes  whereas experimental approaches provide evidence for the adaptive significance of the allele frequency changes  

CSU Monterey Bay 
  Had debate on the nature and worth of deductive vs  inductive  abductive  reasoning  Experimental evidence is very convincing  but a strict deductive perspective is really one applicable to the scale of your experiment and the null hypothesis you are rejecting  
  The abductive inductive approaches can be compelling in the context of the data presented and the authors seem to make good verbal argument for the expectation  
  One thing pointed out about landscape genomic approach is that the evidence identified based on the population allele frequencies would indicate a populationlevel response and possibly a metapopulationlevel response  which is different than the experimental approach and its limited scale  
  People seemed to favor an approach that included both types of information is probably closest to an abductive reasoning model  

Univ  Queensland 
  The snail study allows us to infer particular phenotypes  or traits  that are likely underpinning fitness in some ways  phenotypes under selection   
  Experimental approach allows us to explicitly test for factors underlying local adaptation  
  Genomic approaches can possibly give us insights into the genetic underpinnings of local adaptation  Genomic studies may  however  give clues about genomic architecture underlying selection such as the number of loci involved  their sizes  etc  
  However  in the fly paper  the genomic approach is geared more toward generating hypotheses than inferring processes causing local adaptation  

   How are the processes that drive local adaptation in the snail differ from the fly How are they similar

Rutgers
  Do we really know whats driving adaptation in the fly In the snail paper  abiotic environmental factors drove changes in biotic distribution  which lead to local adaptation through predatorprey interactions  This could be happening in the flies too  but we can only hypothesize based on changes in protein structure and regulation that are impacted by the genetic differences that were found  
  In theory  doing genomics on the snails and experiments on the flies would allow researchers to make important connections between physical properties of chromosomes  likely mutations  and the effects of these mutations on phenotype  

Univ  Southern California 
  The snail system makes a cogent case for both biotic and abiotic determinants driving potential for local adaptation  In drosophila the cline was largely noted as being driven by climate and temperature without specific reference to biotic aspects  
  It is possible that populations of Drosophila across the cline experience drastically different biotic environments such as the predominant food item available especially in the case of agricultural products which may have different amounts of insecticide  
  In both systems there is a latitudinal gradient to the adaptation albeit that the determination of a cline in the snail population is difficult given data from four populations  

CSU Northridge 
  Discussed how differences in life history between the two species could drive local adaptation  With snails  processes of localized recruitment  shorter spatial dispersal  availability of prey could increase selective pressure for certain traits in microhabitats  In the fly system  we were unsure how the organismal interaction with the environment would affect its ability to adapt  
  Authors in the fly study identify differences in the genome across latitudinal clines  however there are many factors that may drive changes in the genome  temp  prey resources  habitat availability   
  Annotation of genes would be necessary to determine the processes that may drive local adaptation  and that a further ecological context is needed to interpret if this is in fact local adaptation 

Virtual Group
  Lots of similarities between the systems  mainly nice clinal systems and large population sizes  
  Differences in life history may make the snails more likely to have local adaptation at small scales  short dispersal with very local recruitment  The main difference is that the snail system took the abiotic variation along the cline and identified the biotic consequences as compared to the rather straightforward abiotic focus in the flies  That extension is really nice and highlights how we need to focus on how abiotic parameters affect more than just physiological processes  
  Patterns of adaptation in snails very interesting  Because southern snails lack preferred prey  they have evolved to be able to consume a more broad array of prey than northern snails; their niche is expanded  This leads to an interesting reaction norm where southern snails have no change in fitness but northern snails have an adaptive pattern  
  We discussed for a while which population has actually adapted to their environment  On the surface it appears that the northern population has evolved  but probably the southern population has adapted to be able to consume larger prey If this is true  then the population that has adapted shows no patterns of local adaptation  
 
Washington State U 
  Papers were too different to give a fair comparison  Question is not answerable based on these two papers alone  but thinking about general knowledge about these animals  we can say that the reproductive  environmental  dispersal  and many other processes are still so different they cannot be compared 

Northeastern MSC
  The Nucella study was focused on prey availability and feeding behaviors of the Oregon and California populations  While some abiotic factors like temperature  were accounted for  other factors  like the long term shaping of population behavior by winter temperature differences couldnt be explicitly considered  Experimental approach does require focusing on very explicit factors driving local adaptation  
  Drosophila study highlighted a range of factors potentially driving local adaptation  including thermal stress  insecticide resistance  circadian cycle differences  and mating behavior  
  Agreed that genomic approaches are very useful for hypothesis generation and can in fact generate multiple potential hypotheses per study while experimental approaches serve better to test explicit hypotheses and are by necessity only focused on a few factors  
  Wish that authors of snail paper had clarified terms instead of saying show local adaptation to show signatures of local adaptation since without knowing which population is ancestral  cant say which is showing the adaptation  

Bodega UC Davis UC Santa Cruz 
  In both examples  local adaptation is driven by differences in environmental variables  but directly so in the case of drosophila  while there was no evidence that temperature differences were driving divergent selection in Nucella  
  However  regional differences in upwelling lead to changes in the strength of species interactions of Nucella with various prey species  driving differences in foraging pressures  Drosophila case  latitude factors  Snail  prey availability driven by differential recruitment  
  Nucellas life history traits limit gene glow  but drosophila seem to have fewer physical boundaries to gene flow  Effective population size of drosophila also much greater  leading to a minimal impact of drift  

Nicholls State 
  Only discussed that snail is in an intertidal zone and the scale of the experiment was much smaller than the temperate versus tropical scale of the fruit fly  
  How can this be communicated to a broader audience Is one type easier to communicate to the public when trying to explain importance of local adaptation to climate change 

UConn UT Arlington 
  If local adaptation means increased fitness within an environment  got nitpicky that fitness wasnt defined in the Fly paper  Drosophila altered development in response to abiotic forces  while Snails altered biology to deal with biotic forces  prey availability   
  Discussion that patterns in biology tend to be in response to abiotic forces  longitude and upwelling   

Old Dominion 
  Both papers investigate heterogenous environments with populations separated by geographic barriers resulting in restrictions of realized gene flow  Local adaptation in both examples are driven by abiotic processes  but biotic processes are also drivers of local adaptation in the snail  
  Biological processes under local adaptation at the genomic level were not as thoroughly analyzed in the fly paper 

Cornell
  Ultimately  the processes driving local adaptation in both systems are directly or indirectly linked to differences in abiotic factors  either climate or upwelling  
  In the snail  differences in prey abundance  which are associated with abiotic differences are drivers of local adaptation  whereas in the fly paper  abiotic differences seem to directly be the driver of local adaptation 

UConn Marine Science 
  Obvious differences in the scope of both studies  Snail study uses system with similar climatic environments but different oceanographic contexts and prey availability  The fly paper uses a system that spans a larger geographic range with more distinct environmental differences 
  Comparing the two  one might interpret the lack of prey and difference in climates to drive adaptation for each respective study  how they are different   while both papers suggest that trait differentiation within the metapopulation seems to be the result of local adaptation  similarities   
  We are not convinced that either represents the local adaptation they seem to suggest  Both papers suggest evidence for some traits that are the result of adaptation  but without measuring fitness for each trait difference with respect to the environment  we cannot conclude that either the snails or the flies are locally adapted  This does not suggest that the information presented is invaluable  just suggests that that the way the data is presented leads the way for future studies  

UC Santa Barbara
  Found snail paper unique in that both the selective pressures and the fitnessrelated traits being studied were directly linked to community level processes rather than purely organismal ones  
  Much of local adaptation literature is rooted in organismal processes  community and ecosystemlevel variation is crucial when considering how marine systems will be impacted by changing environmental conditions  In the case of flies  there are likely a myriad of selective pressures that differ between the two habitats that were studied  which were likely rooted in community and ecosystem processes and not just the physical environment  

UC Merced
  Specific to these studies  it is difficult to define processes and compare the lines of evidence provided  because they are so different  
  Aside  transplants on ecosystems in the wild are approached with caution much more now than in the past  

Northeastern 
  Processes that drivelocal adaptationin the snail are mediated by both biotic and abiotic processes  via spatially consistent differences in upwelling that lead to differences in prey recruitment  In contrast  the processes that drivelocal adaptationin the flies are primarily abiotic  
  Both selective regimes were persistent in space  

Louisiana State 
  Do not agree the fly paper demonstrated presence of local adaptation in the fruit fly  Analysis of differential genotypes led to the detection of interesting patterns  which may be a good starting point for formulating hypotheses that should be methodically pursued  but patterns do not necessarily correspond with local adaptation  
  Paper on snails challenged to rethink definition of local adaptation  which they originally defined as reciprocity in fitness as a result of home away comparison  because  on the one hand  we view the fitness differences  local vs foreign  between the CA and OR populations in the California sites as evidence for local adaptation  but on the other hand  we view the fitness differences between the populations in OR as fitness differences but not necessarily evidence of local adaptation  
  In the case of the snails  since there are many unknowns and variables to be considered such as the effect of drilling efficiency likelihood of mussels on snail fecundity  concluded that Snail paper provided evidence for local adaptation in California sites  there was not enough to definitively determine that local adaptation was occurring  Not every population has to be locally adapted in their own locality  

CSU Monterey Bay 
  Didnt spend much time  ultimately it was the same evolutionary forces at work here that we would see in any study  although of course  things like the nature of selection could definitely vary  

Univ  Queensland 
  In the snail experiment  biotic factors impose selection on the snails  In contrast  the fly study seems to examine the effect of physical factor  particularly temperature  in inducing local adaptation  
  Note that inferring spatial factors underlying local adaptation will be difficult with few populations

   What kind of genomic architecture to expect to evolve under high gene flow

FSU 
  Many quantitative phenotypes involved in local adaptation  so having many small effect alleles prone to swamping and high turnover is probably common  

WSU
  Better appreciations for possibilities but havent been able to develop rule set for genomic architecture  
  Haldanes rule balancing selection with migration is best null hypothesis  

Cal State 
  High gene flow favors genomic architecture with fewer  larger  and tightly clustered alleles  
  Small mutations may occur but expect larger alleles to have greater effect  
  Genetic redundancy  rate and size of mutation  and allele effect size will affect ability of gene to persist  

UMass Amherst 
  Inversions are maintained and spread primarily due to suppression of recombination  and if recombination were to occur  it would be lethal to the individual  
  Migration selection balance  number of loci captured by inversion was driving factor in determining fate of inversion  
  If they are such powerful drivers  why dont we detect them more often Technological capacity 

Uchicago
  Small effect loci depends on genome size complexity  Most of results  yeoman  based on number of loci and genetic redundancy of trait  Finding these out is difficult  but perhaps feasible using combo of GWAS and quantitative genetic based approaches  
  Allelic patterns of divergence might change over time during local adaptation  where allele effect size might be most important at beginning of local adaptation  
  Common challenge  if patterns of adaptation we observe now are due to historical evolutionary processes  can we use them accurately to make future predictions 
  Time scale over which spatially fluctuating selection pressures drive local adaptation is distinct than rate at which adaptation to rapidly changing environmental conditions occur 

USC 
  Strongly differentiated motifs can withstand gene flow  while moderate or weakly differentiated more likely to be swamped  
  Inversions expected to become fixed  increased migration increases fixation because recombination with immigrants in the ancestral haplotype lowers the frequency of adaptive alleles  

Nicholls 
  It depends and its complicated  If organism has genome sequenced  then forward genetics are possible with more informative markers  Non model may be limited to just reverse genomics  
  May miss signal of if only using outlier SNPs if there is high gene flow  especially when considering alleles of small effect  
  Finding candidate genes pathways may be only way to identify local adaptation in this case  
  Using markers beyond SNPs is highly exciting but marker choice comes down to question  do you want to prove local adaptation May be impossible  but useful for management conservation  
  Getting bogged down in mechanism may be informative for basic science but may not be useful in application  
  Combining genomics with epigenetics  transcriptomics  or proteomics may help  

Rutgers
  How likely is it for beneficial inversions to occur 
  No single genomic architecture is likely to evolve under high gene flow but what emerges is highly context specific depending on system  traits under selection  degree of genetic variation already present in the genome  etc  \

UCDavis
  Echoing Haldane  locally favored allele would be lost when immigration rate of maladapted genotype exceeds strength of selection against it  
  Echoing Felsenstein  At higher migration rates  locally adapted allele will spend a larger proportion of its evolutionary time in environments wehre it is disfavored  and above a critical migration rate it may have lower fitness than intermediate 
  Yeaman  if migration between difrerent environments  might predict that stable maintenance of allelic polymorphism would be effectively prevented by swamping if all genetic variants are of small effect relative to migration rate  
  Migration homogenizes populations which is gene swamping  
  Without change in environment  would expect constant molecular clock  Kimura suggests that most mutations are neutral  
  Maynard Smith  real adaptation occurs in sequence space that is discrete  Number of possible sequences for a gene is limited  Adaptive walk with different local optima  with too much migration  there is no walk  

ODU
  Genomic architecture = non random arrangement of genome and can be seen in chromosomes  gene inversions  loci  genes  or number of copies  
  High gene flow  alleles are migrating from one population to another bringing in both adaptive  maladaptive  and neutral alleles  
  Gene swamping will flod the locally adapted alleles of original populations under certain circumstances  
  Genome architecture would likely be similar in population experiencing high gene flow  
  Oneoff events could create barrier to gene flow  making genome architecture more likely to be different  

HalDames
  Any genomic architecture that creates post zygotic barrier and or prevents recombination could be fixed in a population despite high rates of gene flow  
  Inversion and chromosome duplication good examples of genomic architecture that allow maintenance of fitness despite influx of maladaptive alleles  
  Alleles with small effect that are numerous redundant may be more adaptable to changing environments  Alleles constantly being swamped by other alleles of small effect  which allows fitness of individuals in population to vary slightly  May mean that locally adapted alleles never reach fixation  
  Very difficult to detect small genes  transient nature means that It would be difficult to capture the exact snapshot in the populations history where this suite of alleles is adaptive  
  Chromosome inversions seem easier to detect especially given whole chromosome sequencing  

Cornell 
  Might inversions be less favored when there is more complex fitness landscape 

Northeastern 
  Didnt test whether inversions tend to evolve in high migration scenario  so it is difficult to know if they are likely to evolve under high gene flow  
  However  if you think of these as alleles of large effect  it is possible to rationalize  but needs to be tested  
  Yeaman showed how polygenic traits comprised of many alleles could evolve depending on migration mutation rate  Demonstrating that even transient alleles could influence the adaptive divergence of a population when there was sufficient genetic redundancy and mutation  
  Did not find compelling evidence that specific architecture could broadly expected  

CSU Monterey
  Large effect sizes in single celled organisms enhances purifying selection to such an extent that it eliminates non coding junk DNA  
  This selection yields efficient genomes with different architectures in multicellular orgs  
  But marine species often have large effective sizes and high gene flow  which tends to unify local populations  Larger effective size might have less junk dna as a result  but yet to look into it  
  An inversion that captures + beneficial alleles will spread faster given high gene flow is interesting and plausible  

LSU 
  Interesting delineation between genetic and genomic  Paper suggests that genomic architecture describes potential loci that could result in adaptive trait  while genetic architecture is representative of currently variable loci contributing to adaptive trait  

  How does genomic architecture constrain adaptation

WSU 
  Depends on what is meant by genomic architecture  constrain  and adaptation  Definitions are context specific  Depends what system and what you measure  If it is context dependent  is it worth pushing for a general definition 

Cal State 
  If allele effects are large  could swamp out newer alleles even if they are adaptive   does not consider fitness aspect of the population   
  Populations are never stable as conditions constantly change  
  In perfectly stable environment  would anything change Theory based on stagnant environment 
  Philosophical conundrum that our understanding is from selective pressures of the environment 

USC
  Redundancy and migration can limit fixation of alleles and constrain adaptation
  Inversions can capture locally adapted alleles but may also capture deleterious alleles at other loci  which may prevent fixation
  Inversions may fix advantageous alleles  but if the environment changes  these organisms cannot recombine with those who lack the inversion to adapt to new conditions   
  Small effect alleles may be more likely to contribute to local adaptation on a short term scale  but may not persist due to swamping  

Rutgers
  Pace of adaptation may differ depending on if trait of interest is governed by mainly large or small effect alleles  If large  adaptation should be fast with larger jumps in fitness as beneficial alleles move to fixation then plateauing  Small effect = slower adaptation because of weaker selection  Transient nature of adaptive genomic architecture with small alleles may further slow this pace  

UCDavis
  Linkage when strength of divergent selection on linked locus is large relative to recombination rate between them  
  Only large effect alleles will contribute to divergence while quantitative genetic models predict that divergence will evolve as long as genetic variation is maintained  
  Quantitative genetics standing genetic variation is due to many alleles of small effect  Fst would not pick up differences in alleles in second scenario  
  As number of loci contributing to trait increases  relative contribution of fst at individual loci decreases  while among population covariatnce in allele effect size tends to contribute more  
  Kimura mutations must be beneficial but also to escape accidental loss when rare
  Welch and Waxman cost of complexity is that distance traveled to optimum by a benefical mutation is smaller in a complex than simple species  Complexity = number of characters   

ODU 
  Constraint is high gene flow bc will homogenize  
  Not necessarily less genetic diversity  Barrier to genetic recombination necessary to lead to local adaptation  whether they be inversions  linkages  etc  
  How often to large effect genes lead to adaptation vs  small effect genes 
  Larger areas of genome likely to be linked than originally thought  which could reduce local adaptation  
  Length of sequence is limited  so effect of mutation on a specific gene limited 

HalDames
  Inversions may make populations more rigid in face of climate change  
  Altered genomic architectures may not be able to take advantage of new alleles delivered by gene flow  These pops may need to rely on new mutations  

Northeastern
  Question could be interpreted different ways depending on how you define constraint  
  Could reduce number of ways adaptation could occur  or limit the rate or likelihood of adaptive evolution  
  Low mutation rates  minimal standing genetic variation  decreased genetic redundancy in polygenic traits  
  Inversions could also constrain adaptation when new adaptive inversions rapidly rise to fixation  Inversions are well adapted but have limited variation  
  Potential from underdominance or maladaptation due to recombination between inverted and noninverted chromosomes might serve to further limit variation  so if environment were to shift  population of newly fixed inversion may be limited in response  
  Larger effect size might improve efficiency of selection on adaptive allele  
  If inversions are considered alleles of large effect size  then could facilitate faster rate of adaptive evolution  however highly context dependent  
  With poly genic traits  if variation is limited  there is limited potential fro adaptation  

CSU Monterey
  Stumped  but hox genes  which must be kept in same order on chromosome  inversion in this region would not be beneficial  

LSU 
  If no linkage or proximity  adaptation can be constrained  
  With inversions  potential for propagation of both positive and negative alleles in a population  
  Inversions can present meiotic incompatibilities resulting in reduced fitness further constraining adaptation and possibly leading to speciation  
  Location of mutations as well as mutational target size can also constrain  
  Different areas of genome have different likelihoods of mutations  CpG islands have higher mutation rates  and size of mutation can influence persistence  

  What are the implications of different genomic architectures for our ability to study adaptation using genomic data

FSU 
  Ability to use genomic data depends on of unknown locus of transcience and allele turnover rate relative to recent history of ecological causes of divergent selection on phenotypes  

UGH UNH
  Focus on few  large effect vs  many  small effect and how to detect causal loci  Experimental design  cmg  rt  affects the ability to pinpoint candidate genes  

Virtual Group 
  Large effect genes have gotten most focus  but this is unwarranted  
  Genomic architecture has huge influence on how well we identify local adaptation  
  Standard measures of differentiation  Fst and GEA  rely on loci of large effect with little no redundancy but miss class of polygenic traits driven by small effect loci  
  Polygenic signal likely to be common in physiological adaptation  
  How can we id polygenic stuff in non model GWAS New approaches 

Cal State
  Complex orgs evolve slower bc mutations tend to be more deleterious for less complex organisms  Is this bc there are more genomic redundancies 
  Interesting to see how different lineages evolve due to genomic architecture 
  Papers mention that changes in genome structure dont always scale to phenotype
  Not sure of next steps  what should we target If we want to assess if a population is subject to gene swamping from high gene flow  how would we assess Impractical to assess karyotype or determine standing gen  variation in nonmodel organisms what alternative techniques are available 

UMass Amherst 
  Need to look at genes with small but significant effects  not just Fst outliers  
  Should also be considering how we study polygenic traits with differing levels of genetic redundancy  

Uchicago
  Wish to know more about prevalence of inversions in marine species  data is sparse 
  Likelihoods of inversions probably different across species  depending on genome size complexity  or structure of genome around trait of interest  
  Are larger genomes more susceptible Are polygenic traits more likely to be affected by inversion
  Determining species specific inversion rates and genomic architecture are critical steps  

USC 
  If working in marine systems with high gene flow  large effect alleles will likely be the ones contributing to local adaptation  
 
 Rutgers
  May need several different techniques to study local adaptation  as not all architectures result in equally detectable signatures of selection adaptation 
  Small effect alleles may often go undetected while large effect likely to be identified via fst outliers  
  How do we detect inversion Look for linkage blocks or by comparing gene positions in two populations of closely related species 

UCDavis
  Large alleles have higher probabilities of establishing  What is large allele Is size dependent on phenotype Can we define it as proportion of phenotypic variance it can explain 
  Simulations show that local adaptation can occur when individual alleles underlying a trait are prone to swamping  given enough genetic variation  
  Genetic variation is key  Adaptation under migration selection balance cannot always be predicted by deriving traditional population genetic models for the maintenance of polymorphisms and extrapolating to the whole genome  Rather  adaptation is quantitative genetic phenomenon  
  If high genetic redundancy and variation  there can be high turnover in loci that contribute to divergence even when individual alleles are highly swampresistent  
  Adaptation via swamping prone genes can occur when selection acts on traits that are quantitative  but unlikely in traits with simple genetic basis  
  Solution to combine popgen with quantitative genetics approach  GWAS to estimate genotype values by taking frequencyweighted sum of individual SNP effects on trait of interest  Berg and Coop     

ODU
  Difficult to study underlying genomic architecture for most phenotypes  Difficult to know what is driving local adaption via observing changing phenotypes  
  Effect of genome architecture could be better understood with better sequencing technology that can identify structural changes in chromosomes 

HalDames 
  Genetic mechanism underlying local adaptation could influence how organism responses to changing environment  rigid vs  pliable  so might be important for predictions  Just dont know how to detect  

Cornell 
  Different constellations of alleles at many loci that can produce optimum phenotype  When this occurs  detectable fst outliers may be few  GWAS approach by Berg and Coop was mentioned  but It requires that a trait be identifyied and a large sample size  and may be prone to false positives  

Northeastern 
  If we expect small allele genes to drive adaptive divergence  we lack power to detect them  
  Methods that evaluate each locus individually biased towards individual alleles of large effect  due to expectation that they are more strongly correlated with phenotype or environment  
  Many small alleles under weak selection may not have dominant frequencies that are highly differentiated or corrupted beyond what wed expect with null model   below threshold of detection   

CSU Monterey
  Curious about inability to detect many small genes  
  Encouraged by idea that at higher migration rates  more alleles would be swamping prone  but any alleles large enough to resist swamping would be more readily distinguished from neutrally evolving loci  
  GWAS an option  alternatively could look for difference in mutation rates estimated over temporal range of molecular clock calibrations  Time dependence hypothesis  genes that show rate in calibration time are likely experiencing mild purifying selection  
  Marine species have shallower decline in mutation rate than terrestrial species  probably due to larger effective population sizes  

LSU 
  May be detection bias for alleles of large effect  and easier detection doesnt make them more common  
  Identifying Fst outliers may not be sufficient for detecting alleles of small effect  
  Would only be able to see it if more than one locally adapted alleles are caught in the inversion  
  Absence of identification of alleles of small effect not enough to claim absence  
 

Week  Dispersal 

Summary Groups discussed dispersal based on papers by Pringle and Wares    Marine Ecology Progress Series  and Connolly et al     Ecology 

   How might pelagic life histories with asymmetrical dispersal  coupled with genetic correlations between larvae and adult traits  constrain or promote adaptation 

RU 
  Pelagic larvae constrain evolution  Things that enable adaptation increase the ratio of local to migrant settlers  
  Shorter pelagic duration could help or other larval behaviors that improve retention  especially if those are correlated with traits that promote adult fitness  
  Increased pelagicity would constrain ability to adapt by opening population  

LSU 
  Constrain if there is a trait that is beneficial as larva but harmful as adult  would constrain adaptation  
  Promote if there is trait correlated to success in both larval and adult  
  Difficult question  larval stage is where selection may be most important  but this stage is also hardest to research  

NEU 
  Easy to understand how adaptation may be promoted constrained by genetic correlations between traits across stages  across different optima across stages  across traits adapting to different environments  
  Adding asymmetrical dispersal makes it difficult to predict  
  Important result  if allele is favored downstream  but not upstream   gene flow can swamp out this allele entirely unless there is barrier to larval transport  
  Huge implications for inferring adaptation from landscape genomic data  as clines may be established because of barriers to gene flow rather than an area where an allele is actually favored  
  Interesting how reproductive success can vary through space only due to variation in effective population size  good vs  bad habitat  and transport  migration   
  Results more broadly applicable to wind pollinated conifers  as wind can be asymmetric  

WSU
  Depends on relative strength of selection in each life stage  Not as simple as beneficial vs  harmful in direct correlations 
  Relative strength of selection between life stages important  and distinction between trait that is expressed in one stage but affects all vs  distinct traits expressed in multiple life stages that have same function  
  Bet hedging is adaptive and cant make simple connections between high fitness juvenile and adult phenotypes  and genotypes  
  Specific habitats may promote strong connections between life stages  but manifestation in that specific habitat complicates generalizable patterns  

HalDames 
  If dispersal created unidirectional gene flow  cline will be transient unless differences are reinforced by selective pressure   similar to polygenic traits from last week   
  Potentially redundant alleles could temporarily create a locally adapted genotype  but eventually be swamped out by high gene flow from upcurrent  
  If studies use pop genomics to identify local adaptation  researchers could detect false positives if transient differences are result of asymmetric dispersal in absence of selective pressure  
  Impact of isolation by distance would be difficult to distinguish from local adaptation using genetics alone  Should couple with experiments that connect genotypes to habitatspecific fitness  

NoCal 
  Likely to be other factors than upwelling that affect larval community composition  
  Any type of directional force moves genes in one direction alleles adapted to upstream will be put downstream  leading to sourcesink dynamics  Allelic diversity downstream is product of mutation and immigration
  In upstream population  allele frequencies will change like in population with symmetrical dispersal  
  In downstream populations  density dependence limits growth rates and takes a very large selection coefficient to maintain a new allele  Ultimately  this will constrain evolution  
  Another consequence of asymmetrical dispersal is that phenotypes will experience several different environments during different life stages  If there are genetic correlations between larval and adult traits  this can lead to phenotypeenvironment mismatches  
  Will differential gene expression of same genes in different environments life stages a mechanism to counteract this disconnection
  RCN should focus on whole life stage view of evolution
  In the absence of quantitative genetics approaches  the heritability of allele frequency changes observed are unclear  

MIT Woods Hole 
  Positive selection for a linked trait among life stages would promote local adaptation  especially in pops with high degree of selfrecruitment via forces that limit the delivery and settlement of immigrants or promote retention of local genotypes  
  Coordination in direction of selection upon a trait may shift along species range  When coupled with asymmetrical dispersal  this could have interesting outcomes for establishment and maintenance of genetic differentiation  
  Difficult to assess though  

FSU
  Asymmetric dispersal could lead to areas of the coast where postsettlement environments differ  but where migration   selection and where selected alleles cannot persist and avoid being washed out  
  Genetic correlations between larval and adult traits constrain adaptation when they cause reduced genetic variation along the axis that selection occurs  
  Could in theory  lead to areas of the coast where postsettlement environments differ but selection has removed the larval genotypes that would do best there as adults  

UTA
  Adaptation might be constrained due to two life body plans in one genome  Beneficial traits to larvae may not be good for adults and vice versa but depends on environment  
  Asymmetrical dispersion could lead to rapid extinction of rescue depending on environmental factors  
  Strong selection means adaptation will be forced in one direction  In these cases  shorter larval life spans and production of more offspring would be more favorable to local adaptation  

MSC 
  Always returning to basics  tension between gene flow and selection  and how any oceanographic process or life history characteristic that shifts the balance will act to prevent or promote adaptation  
  Strong asymmetrical dispersal will constrain downstream adaptation by dragging allele frequencies away from downstream optimum  which can cause reduced reproductive output and render habitat a sink
  Any genetic correlations between adult and larval traits that would make the incoming larvae less fit in the downstream habitat would reduce their impact on the receiving population  Realized gene flow would be less than predicted based on oceanographic connectivity and dispersal potential  

Katherine Silliman 
  Interesting how clines can also arise due to other processes  Any interruption to gene flow  disruptions in larval transport  habitat availability   
  Clines may also shift downstream if mechanism maintaining them is removed  So cline may not be where it was originally described  Could mess with methods  
  Given sea level rise and even last ice age  possible that clines are moving or have moved from their origin 
  Should consider these factors as we consider adaptation in the future  
  Importance of regional variation in habitat quality disruption of dispersal larval retention on the strength of selection required for maintenance of adaptive divergence  should consider how these factors will change in the future and how that will alter our predictions for adaptation  

USC Cee lab
  Asymmetrical dispersal would constrain adaptation to downstream but may yet still see adaptation due to constant influx of individuals from upstream  
  Locally adapted adults may produce larvae that are swept away from parental habitat and not larvae will not be adapted to environment it recruits to  
  This would reduce fitness and prevent successful gene flow migration or depending on the number of larvae immigrating  generate a less adapted population  
  Genetic correlations could constrain or promote adaptation depending on the relationship of that correlation  For example  traits that are beneficial as larvae but not as adults will improve recruitment but hamper later life history stages  

UCSB
  If asymmetric dispersal is causing one population to receive more propagules from the other it could reduce genetic diversity of the source relative to the sink  
  Whether or not asymmetrical dispersal can widen gaps in adaptive potential between populations may depend on a genetic correlation between stages  type and intensity of selective pressures across life history stages  and probability that larvae will experience selective pressures that exist in habitats within dispersal range  
  If there is poor genetic correlation between larvae and adults   positive selection on larvae could mean that surviving larvae may not improve mean fitness if new population experiences same selection 
  Mating vs  spawning events could have effect on genetic diversity within larval cohort  More partners means more genetic diversity  

Virtual Group
  Selection in the same direction on different stages amplifies selection  but if selection is in opposite directions at various stages  they can cancel each other out
  Selection can be very inefficient with traits on different stages  but depends on strength of selection  If they are opposite  never going to reach peaks at any stage  
  Maybe you can persist where you arent most favored  you can do it because larval stage is more favored increasing the spread of favorable allele  
  Could be differences between free and directed dispersal  More probable that different traits are selected in larvae and adults for freeliving larval stage and they can have different feeding requirements but can that give more opportunity to persist at different habitats  why this happens so often for marine organisms 
  How about outcome if have two adult populations on two different selective habitats  and larvae only coming from one  Selection for larvae happens only in one habitat but selection on adults happens in both  Possible swamp out 

CSU Monterey
  If adaptive alleles keep getting washed down stream  there may be selection for mechanisms that retain larvae like swimming or lecithorophic life histories  brooding  or shorter pelagic durations  
  Stronger current  the stronger the selection to keep adapted individuals close  
  Should see higher proportion of species with retention mechanisms in vicinity of boundary currents  but do not know if this is true  

CSUN
  If there is strong connectivity between adult and larval populations  expect strong correlation between adult and larval traits  and less of an ability to adapt  
  High connectivity and high allele frequencies constrain local adaptation  Asymmetrical dispersal may promote adaptation  Larvae that come in waves with different genotypes could promote gene swamping thus leading to more adaptation potential over time  

Cornell 
  Multivariate breeders equation is good example of how evolution and adaptation in different stages can either be constrained or promoted  
  Dispersal period between the two stages and gauntlet that larvae experience can further complicate things  
  Where there is asymmetric dispersal due to  say advective current  simply having selective advantage is not enough to promote adaptation  Recruits must settle  survive  and reproduce  Selection coefficient alone is not enough to predict  
  How to detect adaptation in such systems Focus on withincohort patterns at different stages or with multiple populations at multiple loci over time  
  Under a linear model  also wondered what the implciations for adaptation were for the upstream source populations  assuming they are in marginal habitat  

ODU 
  When asymmetrical dispersal occur  there is a possibility of having a source sink type structure where crowding occurs downstream  In this situation  local adaptation is promoted but for migrating alleles  it might be more of a challenge to survive and adapt locally  
  Dispersal increases gene flow  but alleles of migrants migh be maladaptive locally possibly reducing their fitness and constraining adaptation for these alleles  

UQ
  Oceanographic processes like upwelling can dictate where larvae settle  Distribution of alleles is further finetuned by a number of abiotic and biotic variables  Genetic clines are maintained if selection for downstream alleles is strong or variance in oceanographic processes is high  such that local recruitment is encouraged and outweighs Lphenotype environment mismatchadv downstream  
  Balancing act between the strength of selection and environmental stochasticity also depends on other factors that modulate larval dispersal like currents and time of pelagic stage  
  These parameters are likely to be species specific  so can we expect to see consistency in where genetic structure forms and persists when different species are compared Should carefully consider both oceanographic processes and larval behaviors that maximize Ldiff  

  When and where do we expect population genetic structure to be generated and or maintained 

RU 
  Tension between selection and dispersal  open and closed populations  
  Components that maintain differentiation are selection and environmental heterogeneity  
  If selection strong enough  downstream allele with fitness advantage could create genetic cline  Or a neutral allele could be maintained if there is some barrier  Either way  increased retention relative to immigration makes for a more closed population  enabling persistence  
  Real world probably in middle traits with small selective advantage able to persist in the face of immigration because of environmental heterogeneity that increases larval retention   
  As barriers to dispersal decrease  strength of selection would need to increase  and this would be modulated by life history traits like pelagic duration  fecundity  agency of larvae  etc  

LSU 
   criteria    Gradient in selection for downstream allele    Sufficient selection downstream of the cline to retain the downstream allele against advection    Insufficient selection upstream of the cline to prevent the cline from moving upstream  
  May also be affected by habitat quality  If upstream is better quality  may prevent from moving upstream but could swamp out cline 

NEU 
  Need better understand the heterogeneous landscape of selection relative to migration across seascapes  the mean and stdev of dispersal distance  variation in effective population size  variation in habitat quality  and nature and strength of selection  
  Connelly paper saw strong patterns which highlights important role of competition when recruitment is high  

WSU
  When there are barriers to dispersal and or strong selection AND the phenotype is result of specific genotype  

HalDames 
  Population structure depends on both pre and post recruitment barriers  Longer pelagic larval duration and more prominent headlands contribute to prerecruitment barriers  local adaptation and historic effects  e g  limited space availability  contribute to postrecruitment barriers  
  Distinctions are helpful if population mixing is constrained to one part of the life cycle
  Ability to adapt could be a trait that is under selection  plasticity vs  fixed traits 

NoCal 
  Pringle and Wares paper shows the effect of population dynamics on the retention of alleles  and one can discover how to define populations  demes  in a coastal system  id source sink populations  and show how these populations are related to ocean circulation that drives dispersal  
  What is population  deme  Can we label regions of relatively uniform allele frequency as a population Any novel allelic diversity that arises will be swept downstream by currents and will not contribute to evolution of allelic diversity upstream  
  Including spatial structure of habitat and circulation will help define population genetic patterns  

MIT Woods Hole 
  Genetic structure would be promoted by strong differential fitness across species range  especially when coupled with discontinuities in connectivity and or heterogeneity in habitat quality  
  Very relevant given Connolly paper  interesting to compare with genetic studies  
  Differences in upwelling probably play some role  but wondered how differences in adult abundance between OR and CA may be responsible for differences in recruitment  Mention that magnitude of difference in recruitment vs  density is greater  but its possible its nonlinear  possibly quadratic 
  Because difference in recruitment was mostly just across Cape Blanco and not gradual latitudinal pattern  could be any number of biogeographical differences that contribute to the observed difference in recruitment  

FSU 
  Important part of paper not only showing how alleles that are favored can persist without being washed out  but how asymmetric dispersal can keep an allele from being common in many places where it is selectively favored  
  Structure still generated by migrationselection balance  but in continuous space  oceanographic features may cause the break cline to form in places not predicted by divergent selection or environmental differences  
  Could mean results from reciprocal transplant experiments might differ depending on where within the downstream region individuals were sampled and transplanted  

UTA
  For genetic structure to be generated  there must be strong selection downstream relative to upstream or restricted gene flow from downstream to upstream  
  As selective pressures and dispersal types vary across a large range for species  can expect genetic structure to be generated  

MSC
  Pringle and Wares demonstrates importance of barriers to gene flow  expect structure adjacent to such barriers  
  Interesting that geographical feature maintaining genetic cline may not be necessarily what generated it  
  Could be genetic cline that slides down coastline until they catch at a spot where the demography geography shifts the gene flow selection balance  
  Spent time on Fig    could use reciprocal transplant to see GxE as source effect  

USC Cee lab
  Should see genetic structure maintained when there is change in selection across dispersal range  Produce individuals more suited to local environment and thus local adaptation  
  Similar to last weeks discussion of local microgeographic adaptation where selection must be large enough to outweigh gene flow  
  For asymmetrical dispersal  a break in larval dispersal would generate differentiation either by selection or drift between upstream and downstream populations 
  Where selection is not unidirectional  you would expect to see population genetic structure based on reduced gene flow such as with dispersal in Connolly paper  

Virtual Group 
  Connolly paper was purely ecological  patterns may look like selection but are actually due to dispersal currents  
  What is role of species evolutionary history geologic history 
  Historic gene flow due to sea level leads to enough divergence to prevent mixing when oceanographic sea level would permit  
  Secondary contact vs  selection patterns  
  Need to collaborate more with physical oceanographers  connect them to genetic people  

CSU Monterey
  Absence of genetic structure does not necessarily indicate a high level of gene flow  Even in simple allopatric scenario  Fst will be  in  of replicates  
  Genetecists should take greater notice of coastal boundary layers that may decrease U and Lphenotype environment mismatchadv while increasing Lphenotype environment mismatchdiff  Paper only discusses when Lphenotype environment mismatchadv is greater than Lphenotype environment mismatchdiff  but opposite could be true  meaning dispersal against boundary current should not only be possible but perhaps common  Would lower threshold for selection to maintain cline or allow absence of habitat to more readily create structure 

CSUN 
  Expect it when there is some sort of gradient in abiotic or biotic conditions  These tend to be maintained when alleles are not swamped  
  In certain areas  larvae have larger impact on adult populations via influx of beneficial alleles  

Cornell
  Structure could exist from simply neutral stochastic patterns and or from a spatial gradient in habitat selection  
  In terms of the Connolly paper  north and south seemed to have different selection pressures  space  recruitment  predation  and so there could be genetic structure and adaptive differences 
  Even with a gradient in recruitment along coast  was it truly local recruitment How many were carried from north via current 
  Plasticity and responsiveness and sensitivity to environmental conditions cues can lead to adjustments and fine tuning of the timing of recruitment  Predictability of such events would facilitate a response  

ODU
  Genetic structure is expected to be generated in areas with barriers to gene flow  When and where depends on duration of barrier  
  Oceanographic events can both restrict and promote gene flow  Some of these have seasonal differences which can cause variation in gene flow depending on a species life history  

UQ 
  Strong links between larvae and adult phenotypes can influence the strength of selection required for structuring and adapting marine population with strong asymmetric dispersal  
  Selection against settling larvae manifests through habitat availability and competition  which does not capture selection acting on adult phenotypes and reproductive success  
  Given that strength and direction of selection can vary between life stages  question whether alleles favored in downstream environments at settlement would also be favored in adults if larval experiences in the plankton impose strong evolutionary constraints on adult populations  
  Knowing about such tradeoffs is central for understanding how selection operates across life cycles  


Week   Population Genetics 

Summary Discussion based on papers that examined how coalescent theory  Eldon and Wakely   Genetics  and how continuous vs  discrete spatiatl distributions  Bradburd et al     Genetics  affect genetic structure and differentiation 

   What are the implications for sweepstakes reproduction on how we model evolutionary processes in the ocean 

WSU 
  If SR is big term in model  wouldnt be able to model evolutionary processes as we see them in lab observations
  Need to track individuals through time to see if sweepstakes is truly random
  Looking at input output distributions for mero holoplanktonic larvae in the same environment  you can evaluate the relative importance of SR

HalDames 
  Could cause population bottlenecks and impact signatures of local adaptation  
  Effective population size is not capturing the number of individuals that pass alleles to the next generation  so wont scale with TMRCA and pops can diverge quickly  
  Evolutionary history of alleles may be difficult to detect due to repeat bottlenecks  
  How common is SR Is it plastic 

Rutgers 
  SR can play large role 
  Creates large amounts of variability in number of viable offspring recruits  which increases chances of multiple mergers in coalescent process  
  If variability is large or frequent enough  could cause uncertainty in the effectiveness of simpler models that estimate pop  Size or genetic diversity  

NoCal 
  SR can accelerate adaptation if nonrandom in regard to parental genotypes  
  In long term  might reduce genetic variation in populations and decrease adaptive potential  
  How common is SR assume it is rare or may reduce genetic variation 

Umass Amherst
  How does modeling SR differ between marine and terrestrial systems
  SR can cause such extreme variance in reproductive success  and ultimately result in substantial temporal changes in allele frequencies in larval systems  
  Suggest sampling across size classes or age classes in addition to unbiased sampling to avoid inaccurate inferences  

NEU
  Literature seems to focus on selection and drift lately  but there are other factors  
  Which dominates larval stage with genetic patchiness Lately it is selection  earlier was drift  
  Both are at play  but still dont know if one dominates  
  Should have strong considerations when applying moran model  most analyses assume wright fisher model which may cause erroneous conclusions if the species displays evidence of SR 

Cornell 
  With SR  expect reduced genetic diversity  increased relatedness  and more rare variants  
  Could have implications for modeling evolutionary processes  especially given the assumptions of coalescent theory and wrightfisher model  assumes small variance in number of offspring  no sweepstakes   
  In Eldon + Wakeleys model  extends coalescent  offspring of single individual can replace substantial fraction of population  
  Deals with variance in offspring  how much does it improve it compared to traditional methods Is it closer to reality 
  How would this perform with nuclear markers 

USC
  SR changes null expectations as previous coalescent methods estimate inaccurately low effective population size  
  Selection at larval stage could have implications for recruitment  
  Moran model probably always better as null model than wrightfisher coaslescent models  

Laval
  SR is the chances of a highly fecund marine animal contributing offspring to a future pool of reproductively mature adults  a process envisioned to have few winners and many losers  
  In study  Eldon and Wakely highlight coalescent models for accounting for SRS parameters  which is substantial advance  
  Do we need to implement some intrinsic parameters relative to species of concern

MIT
  SR acts as bottleneck and can dramatically reduce genetic variation compared to what we would expect if every individual contributed to next generation  
  In coalescent  multiple mergers become important and coalescence events happen more quickly  
  Models that assume wrightfisher processes rather than accounting for rare reproductive eventus with a modified moran process will tend to underestimate the effective population size if SR is important  

CSU MontBay
  In populations with high variance in reproductive success  coalescent process departs from Kinman coalescent so much that the concept of coalescent population size no longer holds  If this is true  can fit Moran model to a population that shows gamma between   and   then all bets are off with traditional pop gen  
  When family size of reproductive event is large  greater than    then rule of thumb that sample size can be low for coalescent theory no longer applies  Doubt that it would ever be that large  
  In region of parameter space  multiple mergers can lead to star phylogenies and neutrality tests violated in the negative direction  Frequently happens and is usually interpreted as population expansion  selective sweep  or purifying selection  But may be none of the above! 

UT Arlington
  SR creates rush for resources  which could select for most advantageous traits  through bottleneck  and promote traits promoting resource attainment and management  
  Longer time scale  genetic diversity could be hindered  
  Depends on scenario and environmental variables on when it promotes or obstructs adaptation and how rapid adaptation comes at the expense of genetic variance in long term  

MSC 
  Commonly used models assume equal numbers of offspring and discrete populations  so violations like SR can lead to incorrect inferences 
  Authors say coalescent with multiple mergers is better  but even in this model simultaneous mergers are not allowed  so how important is that 
  Wondered how this would play out with nuclear markers 
  Discussed if SR is drift or selection and how it plays role in evolutionary processes  

LSU
  Most models do not take SR into account  
  Source variation is layered  so genetic drift could potentially be misinterpreted with models not accounting for SR  
  Recency of common ancestor  allele frequency vs  kingman model could falsely conclude that an individual has high fitness among a population  So we need effective population size  
  How large of a sample size is sufficient  

UQ 
  SR is probably very important in how we model evolutionary processes in ocean  
  More interrogation into what data would look like with  gamma  wouldve been nice  
  Should be on lookout for multiple mergers and understand consequences on selection  

  Given the complexity of marine dispersal dynamics  do you think we as a field should adopt Bradburd et al  approach for characterizing population structure 

WSU 
  No  need more information 

HalDames
  Might help extract the effect of space  help overcome some issues in detecting local adaptation vs  isolation by distance  

Rutgers
  Can these programs resolve the clusters vs clines problem 
  Compelling way to look at population structure in systems where we think clines may be most responsible for shaping population structure  as ability to run both spatially explicit and nonspatial models gives a large degree of flexibility  

NoCal 
  What are assumptions of construct What are effects of migration dispersal on construct outcome 
  Does construct assume restricted dispersal

Umass Amherst
  Spatial components can be case specific  Temporary congregations of individuals can lead to inaccurate inference when identifying population structure  Another source of bias could be invasion populations 
  Adopting approach beneficial to characterizing pop  Structure  but agreed its a casespecific process and sampling scheme design is critical  
  Idenfiying populations and management units very important  

NEU
  Bradbury approach is useful when analyzing pop structure in species with isolation by distance  
  STRUCTURE has been applied to many studies studying pop structure of species  but assumptions of model are not always considered carefully  
  Like idea of investigating few different Ks rather than picking single one  different k values can help identify large scale vs  smaller scale processes that might be shaping population structure  
  Limitation is that dispersal distance does not equal geographic distance  and membership in layers does not always reflect this  

Cornell 
  construct is expected to perform same as traditional methods when there is no IBD  we wish they had applied it to more no IBD species to confirm  
  Agree that tool is improvement  but may not be flexible enough to apply to marine systems with chaotic patchiness from sweepstakes could generate strongly nonIBD patterns  
  How prevalent is IBD in marine systems  and what spatial scale do we expect to see this pattern 
  Need to make sure construct is appropriate for species distribution sampling before we can sample it  

USC 
  Long dispersal distances may make it difficult to apply method that leans on spatial autocorrelation  
  But isolation by distance is observed in many marine systems so application of bradburd model is viable  
  We should account for migration and dispersal patterns within their system as strong currents can create areas of close relation across large spaces  
  Bradburd model has more conservative method for estimating number of clusters whereas STRUCTURE and its variants tend to overfit data  

UChicago UGA
  Bradbury approach useful for pop gen surveys in which interplay of both discrete and continuous components both important  
  construct requires subjective interpretation by the user  multiple Ks  not best K   Subjectivity is one of greatest issues for standardizing field and facilitating cross species comparisons  
  Perhaps instead of single option  validation through multiple agreed upon methods is best  each with different assumptions etc    
  Approach could generate reproducible datasets along a species range to devise generalities for marine population structure across species range  
  May want to consider user friendly methods  well maintained by authors  
  Also need to find selectively neutral loci  which depends on robust filtering of putatively adaptive loci  Advancements here may be very useful because even small number of nonneutral loci can dramatically alter results 

Laval 
  Yes  until a certain level of genetic relatedness 
  Power of approach is that ultra high connectivity often leads to low Fsts  
  What is tradeoff between having many markers or just informative markers What kind of markers should be used Maximise number of markers or use only informatives  like Fst outliers 

MIT
  Continuous genetic variation is probably often important in marine systems so we think the approach of Bradburd would be a good way to generate hypothesise for organisms whose population structure is not known  but shouldnt be only framework used  
Need to evaluate assumptions relative to the study system  
  Bradburd depends on spatial relationships between samples  But dispersal distance doesnt always correspond to geographic distance  Further  pelagic organisms can have enormous ranges and it isnt clear  Isolation by distance more important for certain species 

CSU MontBay
  Bradbury approach relevant but only relevant to extent  
  Most marine species in waples zone of high Ne and high migration  and dont see evidence that this method will help work in this zone  
  Should be thinking about pop structure based on measured gene flow between populations rather than measured allele frequency differences  
  Coalescent sampler  migration  n  can differentiate populations and identify underlying metapopulation model when Nem is as high as   migrants per generation  

UT Arlington
  Spatial model is interesting and will be better approach for some systems  but should not be used to generalize  
  Dispersal distance doesnt always correlate with geographic distance  
  Model is good step but should be evaluated on system by system basis  

MSC
  Bradbury approach useful in some situations  but not universal panacea  
  Could be modified to deal with other forms of spatial structure in addition to IBD  Best approach comes down to questions and resources  

LSU
  Appropriate for statisticians  However  dispersal distance vs  geographic distance different and important to take barriers into account   
  Both STRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE are great tools  but shouldnt be used alone  Other models should confirm results  As always  with population data  sample size is extremely important factor  so is question  
  Not   on accepting Bradbury approach as field  

UQ 
  Bradburd method is super cool but doesnt help SR problem  Detecting lots of Ks with geographic restricted shifts in allele frequencies if sweepstakes is pervasive  

  Given the potential for high variance in reproductive success  overlapping generations  and a combination of continuous and discrete population structure  how should we sample for population studies  Across space and cohorts 

WSU 
  The more you know about your system  the more appropriate design you can implement  
  Important thing is variance structure in the data  not ecological evol  Hypotheses  
  Different populations questions will always differ in their approach  but may be able to address by understanding underlying variance structures in the data 

HalDames 
  What about software to help figure out what sampling regime might overcome issues in your system 
  Difficulty in sampling makes overcoming some of these issues nearly impossible  
  Instead of increasing fineness of scale  adjust inference about data we have  
  Sampling design contingent on species  environment  and question 
  Simulations needed to determine sampling regime optimal  generate result or model that can be parameterized with system conditions  amount of variation in reproductive success  to determine targeted sampling regimes  

Rutgerss
  Need for larger sampling efforts  more individuals population  especially in SR systems  
  Systems in highly variable reproductive success will be comprised of individuals that will coalesce back to MRCA in a few generations  most of genetic diversity harbored in a few rare individuals  The more uncommon these individuals are  the larger the sampling effort will need to be to give them a fair chance of being sampled and better represent level of diversity actually present in study population  

NoCal
  If SR has taken place and we use coalescent theory  most of alleles will trace back to same ancestor  If we want to learn about evolutionary potential of species  would have to include several populations and sample deeply to infer most recent common ancestory  
  For construct to pick up isolation by distance  would need to sample across distribution and not just at the extremes  
  How do offspring by SR distribute in space Will there still be isolation by distance if sweepstaking in a population is strong

Umass Amherst
  Agree that this is case specific  biology should inform sampling design  
  Reducing geographic scope on a particular site should help reduce noise associated with high variance in reproductive success  in addition to assessing continuous vs  discrete population structure   
  Should consider applying eldon and wakely model to account for organisms that have overlapping generations as opposed to Wrightfisher model that doesnt  
  To reduce bias in sampling  perhaps vary sampling sites over a temporal scale to cover both spatial and temporal scale  but longer lived organisms may not need temporal consideration  

NEU
  Designing sampling scheme is complex and often limitations in how well you can sample  
  When researcher is trying to understand pop dynamics  important to know system and design study to sample across cohorts when possible  
  Even more critical in species with SR  
  Sampling should be more extensive across multiple years because most individuals could be highly related under SR  


Cornell 
  Sampling should be highly dependent on study system  More extensive spatial and or temporal sampling may be needed in some scenarious  
  IBD is common at some scales  but may be at larger scales than is typical of terrestrial systems  so may need to sample more widely  
  Not clear whether random sampling is preferable to stratified sampling based on hypothetical barriers to dispersal  
  Sequencing pools may be better than sequencing individuals  If variation in pool  can we account for it using construct 

USC
  Knowledge of system  life history  will yield best methods for distinguishing generations and variance in reproductive success  
  When there are overlapping generations  binning according to factors like size class could help disentangle separate generations  
  Genetic markers across multiple loci have power to determine population structure better than previous methods  Especially if this approach is combined with taxon specific knowledge could help with initial parsing of complex systems and could be used as scaffold of experimental design  

UChicago UGA
  High variance in reproductive success warrants investigation into the stability of inferred structure through time  
  Sampling method appropriate would be resampling over multiple    generations of a focal species and replicating computational methods to see how structure estimates vary  
  Sampling year generation  need to standardize approximate age life history stage of individuals
  Revised methods for field sampling may be useful fine resolution around geographic breaks
  Unclear how much bias will affect results  or if it would just improve defining finescale clusters  
  Within population sampling important where patterns of microgeographic adaptation are at play  Sampling across range of microhabitats within a population likely most robust means to correct for this  Sampling should be consistent across populations  

Laval
  Impact of SRS could be different over time population size fluctuations  temporal structure  bottlenecks  teLmporal seasonality  over different timescales should be considered  
  Sampling over time and over cohorts seems a good approach to catch the SRS effect  
  However  no matter the sampling approach used  follow population through time or sit in one spot and study what is recruiting locally   each is valid  and when combined  can provide powerful understanding of evolutionary change in marine populations  

MIT
  Sampling regime should reflect biology of study system  Efforts should be made to sample across time and space  and sampling across cohors can become important with species with high variance in reproductive success 
  In marine systems  often critical to understand the physical oceanography of study system  especially for species that have current driven dispersal  

CSU MontBay
  Sampling depends on goal  but for coalescent studies  sampling should take place across cohorts present in population  
  Someone should design method based on Eldon and Wakeley to quickly determine whether sampled population sits in Moran space of     gamma <   SRS   
  Curious how frequently this happens in nature  not just in oysters  
  Noted that long generation times should even out generation to generation variance created by SRS  
  For studies based on coalescence  each genome is product of multiple coalescent processes  so large sample size may not be important if you sample widely across genome  

UT Arlington
  Question depends on study system  questions  context  
  Range and dispersal should be weighed  while temporal parameters  gen time  must be accounted for  
Good to conduct preliminary study to look at pop structure and life history and discuss what definition of population is being used  

MSC 
  This may be productive discussion topic at working group meeting  because optimal sampling method will depend on question being asked and system  may be challenging to come up with guidelines  

LSU 
  Dynamic question that could be addressed a few different ways  Could sample across space and cohorts by using preserved historical samples  Could also give insight into historical sweepstakes events  
  Other way is to sample population studies given all of dynamic variables involved to ensure large sample size to account for rare alleles or events

Week   Group summaries

Summary Groups discussed papers about expansion load during range expansion  Gilbert et al     American Naturalist  and phenotypeenvironment mismatches in the sea  Marshall et al    Ecology Letters   

   Whats the relationships between phenotypeenvironment mismatches and genetic load

Rutgers 
  Hard to parse the connection  Most assumptions based on wellmixed populations  
  Might expect both maladaptation and expansion load to reduce fitness and limit range edges  but there is a lot of nuance  
  Expansion load could be reduced in environments under strong selection if alleles dont surf to fixation  Selection would have to be stronger than what is in the Marshall paper 

WSU 
  No direct relationship
  There are other individuals of your type at the new environment  but what really matters is if one individual happens to get to this environment  As long as someone can get there  its still a random likelihood of high low genetic load because of assumed connectivity  

UMASS Amherst 
  Including expansion load had smaller effect on expansion speed than difference in dispersal types  
  Discussed problem that models assume abundant center distribution which isnt always the case

LSU
  Genetic load is any deleterious allele that puts an individual at a fitness disadvantage  in specific environment or generally   
   types of genetic load expansion load where deleterious alleles get fixed from expanding population  allele surfing   and phenotypic environment mismatches  in which alleles are at a fitness disadvantage if they are in an environment the organism is not adapted to  

NEU 
  Can be interplay of phenotype environment mismatch and genetic load  they arent consistently linked in predictable fashion  
  Gilbert suggests increase in expansion load specifically could slow range expansion to point of overcoming local maladaptation  which could reduce instances ofphenotype environment mismatch But loaded term was uniquely defined and not generally applicable to discussions of genetic load  
  Challenging to measure genetic load without strong contextual clarification  In absence of knowing true optimum  criteria for defining genetic load may be tricky  

UC Davis 
  Genetic load results from accumulation of maladaptive alleles in a population that reduces overall fitness relative to an optimum genotype phenotype environment mismatchoccurs when individuals move from an environment in which they are well adapted to one in which they are poorly adapted  In these new environments  poorly adapted migrants have greater genetic load  resulting in high mortality rate  
  Genetic load relative to environment  Poorly adapted individual moves to another environment  previously maladaptive alleles may become useful phenotypic traits if genetic load was caused by outbreeding depression  Unlikely if genetic load is result of inbreeding depression  

Virtual Group 
  Complex  Marshall paper definesphenotype environment mismatchvery broadly  and Gilbert finds that maladaptation and load interact so each is less effective than expected when alone  
  Difference in outcome between a case where an allele is everywhere maladaptive vs allele that is adaptive in the core but maladaptive in the edge  Depend on demographics  but latter would correspond more closely withphenotype environment mismatch 

Uchic UGA
 phenotype environment mismatchcould be selective agent shaping larval behavior  dispersal  and life history strategy   produce behaviors that promote larval retention 
  Expansion load  local maladaptation  and potential interaction between two important for understanding impact of range expansion on genetic load  
  Challenging to test assumptions and hypotheses of model  

USC 
  During range expansion phenotype environment mismatchwould slow expansion load and allow populations more time to adapt  
  Different environmental gradients would affect this though  
  With decreased environmental gradient  populations could expand further geographically and may lead to decreasedphenotype environment mismatch but increase in genetic load  
  Multiple environmental gradients should also affect  Would there be morephenotype environment mismatchcausing slower range expansions 


UCSB
  Genetic load can contribute tophenotype environment mismatchat population levels  but maladaptive allele frequencies may not wholly determinephenotype environment mismatchsince plasticity may also contribute tophenotype environment mismatchwhen transgenerational plasticity is mismatched with offspring experience  
 phenotype environment mismatchlinked to genetic variation can contribute to genetic load and other factors may contribute  
  Locally adapted population exhibiting mitochondrial traits that are maladaptive in a foreign environment  home to pop b  may increase genetic load to pop B following settlement and reproduction not only throughphenotype environment mismatchbut potentially through mitochondrial incompatibility as well  
  Genetic load may increase after multiple generations introgression of pop A into pop B could reduce offspring fitness via simultaneousphenotype environment mismatchand hybrid breakdown  
  How do authors definephenotype environment mismatchSay that individuals that disperse suffer heightened mortality before reproduction relative to locally derived individuals  where others say its a reduction in fitness when an organism is specialized to one environment finds itself in another  Important because reduction in fitness may not necessitate mortality prior to reproduction  May simply be reduced reproductive success  Immigrant individuals capable of successful  even if reduced  reproduction will contribute to genetic load  
  Temporal env  Heterogeneity in which we might expect temporally variable environments to harbor genotypes associated with increased plasticity  Role of adaptive plasticity mentioned  but could allow propagules to survive settlement and eventual reproduction in foreign environments in spite of having suboptimal genotypes  

Laval 
  Genetic load is composed of many different loads phenotype environment mismatchcause one kind of load  but this is argued in Marshall that this shouldnt happen in marine environment where consequences ofphenotype environment mismatchwill appear before the reproduction of migrants  Suggest thatphenotype environment mismatchwill cause reduction of connectivity in marine environments but no migration load
  Surfing alleles is another type of load  a drift load that appears when frequency of unfavorable or deleterious alleles increases due to stochasticity in small populations  
  Conclusion of Gilbert is that increased maladaptation due to environmental gradient from the center to the edges reduces expansion load and vice versa  increased expansion load will cause that locally adapted populations to have better chance of survival  Maladaptation due tophenotype environment mismatchand expansion load at edges will appear negatively correlated 
  Genetic load andphenotype environment mismatchrelationship will be affected for all kinds of variables  Strength of connectivity between patches  sampling and time scales  kinds of dispersion  as well as environmental change and dynamics adding stress  
 phenotype environment mismatchwill cause migration load  =kind of genetic load  in terrestrial environments  In marine environments phenotype environment mismatchwill reduce connectivity increasing the expansion load due to less migrants and drift load  

Cornell 
  Sincephenotype environment mismatch increase mortality in foreign migrant larval  gene flow is reduced  This could lessen genetic load by allowing local adaptation and inhibiting maladaptive alleles from continually being reintroduced by migrants  migrant load   Reduced gene flow leads to lower Ne  there may be less selection to purge linked deleterious variants  
  Important factor is migration at larval stage  Migration at adult stage could worsen genetic load by inhibiting local adaptation by swamping the migrant load  
  With MPAs  important to think of size and placement of MPAs  If MPAs are smaller than scale of environmental heterogeneity  may be ineffective due tophenotype environment mismatchor may increase genetic load from migrant load  May be better to have many smaller MPAs for greater diversity of protected phenotypes  
  If goal is to reduce genetic load  MPA placement should be chosen according to environmental heterogeneity  

MIT WHOI
 phenotype environment mismatchon broad scale would decrease genetic load as deleterious alleles are actively chosen against  Also produces bottleneck effect that could in the longer term allow for increases in the accumulation of deleterious alleles as drift occurs  
  Also consider innate patchiness of marine environment spatially and temporally  might encourage recruitment of organisms in other conditions would display a phenotypeenvironment mismatch  This would allow for an increase in allelic diversity  which might help act against genetic load accumulated from genetic drift  

UQ 
  Genetic load includes mutation load  expansion load  and migration load  latter two have geographic aspect  
  Expansion load could possibly contribute tophenotype environment mismatchbut main mismatch would most likely stem from maladaptation of migrants or colonizers  
  There are other sources of mismatch especially plastic phenotypes that match source of origin  Physiological debt from long or difficult larval phase could reduce fitness  

MSC
  Equatephenotype environment mismatchto postsettlement selection in marine systems and agree that migration load may be more prominent in terrestrial systems given the life history stage at which dispersal occurs  
  For long lived organisms that experience environmental change  end may be genetic load via a different process  

  How does dispersal scale and the scale of environmental heterogeneity contribute to genetic load 

Rutgers 
  Marine species dont have migration load or less if migrants arent able to establish and reproduce  But other components still apply 
  Components of genetic load still possible for marine species in the case where they are establishing new populations at the edge of their range  assuming they dont go so far that there is no possibility of survival to reproduction   
  Higher load will impede success of high dispersers  if environment changes they will disperse further  
  Expansion load could be limiting the edge of a species range expansion  not dispersal  and slower expansions might allow enough time for selection to act enabling adaptation to the new environment  
  Depends on rate of migrant alleles from core  which could hinder local adaptation  would need to see how migration from core influences fitness at the edge  

WSU 
  Disparity in papers assuming linearity in environmental gradients  heterogeneity  and dispersal gradients  we know these factors arent linear  but models assume they are  
  Can we apply these concepts knowing this disconnect 
  Gibert argues increased slope of an assumed linear environmental gradient reduces genetic load  Means that selection takes a bigger role in the observed effects on the population on a range edge when you have steeper environmental gradient  
  Life history characteristics  broadcast   how can there be relationship with genetic load in adults if selection is happening in a completely different life stage with different selective pressures during larval dispersal 
  MPAs  should think about scale of dispersal and environments when designing ocean spatial management  
  Temporal considerations matter! Cant just consider snapshots in time  

UMASS Amherst 
  Longer distance dispersal strategies may affect expansion load  not just expansion speed  
  Marine species relatively free of migration load due to mortality prior to reproduction 
  Marine species likely to suffer expansion load due to severe bottlenecking that occurs during sweepstakes and selection might outweigh expansion load in these taxa since they are able to persist despite the load  
  Many habitats follow this patchy pattern and apparent lack of connectivity across habitats might be the rule rather than the exception in aquatic environments  May compare with winddispersed terrestrial organisms 

LSU
  Depends on organism and scale of dispersal relative to scale of environmental heterogeneity  Less genetic load if dispersal is large and environmental heterogeneity is small  If dispersal is small but env  Het  Is large  may be more genetic load  
  Steepness of environmental gradient slows range expansion  but more time for the core to adapt to the range edge and ameliorate the high genetic load  
  Assumes environmental heterogeneity in continuous landscape  not mosaic  In mosaic  if dispersal is short  high probability of staying in environment youre adapted to  
  If youre long range disperser  chance of getting to env  Youre adapted to is small  
  To link papers local maladaptation and expansion may interact positively  each making the effects of the other more pronounced  Makes sense but model found opposite  They ameliorate each other  reducing genetic load  
  Could also be interpreted asphenotype environment mismatch all organisms are so maladapted at the range edge with such high genetic load that range edge populations quickly go extinct because they can be rescued by the core  
  Why do organisms disperse ifphenotype environment mismatchexists Environments change through time  dispersal is not as random as we think  as way to increase genetic diversity 

NEU
  Increased dispersal is associated with increased exposure to greater diversity of habitats  and migration load does impact local fitness of adaptive population  but evolutionary theory needed  
  Are orgs  Believed to be broadly dispersing more vagile or more plastic Need to know fitness of genomes in different environments we wont know the pressures that are driving them  
  Pressures could be represented in SNP data  but also indels and variation in genomic architecture  
  Discuss connection between genomic architecture and genetic load  Marine orgs have higher load than terrestrial as consequence of sweepstakes reproduction or increased germline mutation accumulation  possibly also due tophenotype environment mismatch 
  Issue of MPAs  initial fecundity could be high but result in migration load  Load is context dependent  environmental heterogeneity can shift advantage disadvantage of individual variants  
  What is feasibility in terms of planning MPAs Systems arent static  heterogeneous environments shift with heterogeneous populations and it would be good to see more direct consideration of how managers can better account for this  

UC Davis 
  Environmental heterogeneity can be structured as continuous or discretely patchy  May affect genetic load differently depending on dispersal scale  
  When dispersal scales are large  cline will result in high genetic load because farther individuals disperse the more poorly adapted to their environment they are  
  In contrast  in patchy structure  long distance dispersal need not necessarily result in high genetic load bc far flung habitat patches are as likely to be suitable for dispersing individuals as sites near natal locations  
  Higher genetic load is more likely in a patchy structure where nearby sites are just as likely to be good habitats as they are to be poor habitat  
  Example is porcelain crab  which disperses across patchy environment of cobbles and mussel beds  Expect this species to have high genetic load as they are not thought to disperse far  No structure at Fst  maybe structure at Qst 

Virtual Group 
  Expect when scale of dispersal is larger than scale of heterogeneity phenotype environment mismatch migrant load  will increase  

USC 
  If scale of dispersal is greater than scale of environmental heterogeneity  there will be increase inphenotype environment mismatchwhich will slow down range expansions and decrease genetic load  as only those organisms with highest fitness in that environment are surviving to range edge  
  If dispersal is smaller than scale of environmental heterogeneity  genetic diversity will be maintained and there will be little or no genetic load  
  Need clarification of what environmental heterogeneity means  

UCSB
  Increasing scale of dispersion increases the probability that an individual will encounter an environment in which its phenotype is mismatched  which could reduce genetic load by propagules onto new populations  
  This depends on environmental heterogeneity  because long distance dispersers in homogenous environments may contribute to genetic load compared to short distance dispersers settling somewhere across a more heterogenous environment  

Laval 
  When scale of dispersal is high  probabilistically fewer individuals will arrive  in and species with feeding larvae those who arrive will be disadvantageous  therefore decreasing likelihood of carrying deleterious alleles that can act as mutation load  
  Due to surfing alleles  deleterious mutations that arrive to range edge will increase frequency  
  Increased env  Heterogeneity will increase maladaptation due tophenotype environment mismatch maladaptation reduces the pace of expansion producing a reduction in expansion load and a number of migrants 
  In marine environments  the presence of environmental heterogeneity will reduce connectivity  due tophenotype environment mismatch could mean that expansion load will increase in this case too  because in small populations or edge populations drift load  surfing  will increase  

Cornell 
  Relationship of dispersal scale to scale of environmental heterogeneity is more important than the individual scales  
  Greater environmental heterogeneity  the lower we expect genetic load and expansion load  but less connected populations become  
  If dispersal scale is less than environmental heterogeneity we dont expect migrant load  Clear that life history of species is important for management and evolutionary consequences of genetic load  

MIT WHOI
  With larger scale of dispersal  increased likelihood of mismatch between the arriving organisms and environment which would potentially contribute to a bottlenecking of survivors leading to increased genetic load  
  Takes broad scale view of environmental heterogeneity  On smaller scales  more likely that organism would encounter environment that matches its phenotype thus increasing diversity and decreasing genetic load  
  Then important to consider how finetuned the organisms have to be in order to for them to experience significant dieoffs to result in a bottle neck  
  If dispersal is greater than scale of environmental heterogeneity  would result in decreased connectivity in ocean which favors local adaptation being predominant  Also favors increased genetic load as genetic drift occurs  

UQ 
  If organisms dispersal scale includes heterogeneous environments  then there will be migration load  unless phenotypic plasticity allows environmental matching postsettlement  
  Interesting situation would occur where environment changes rapidly  steep gradient  and therefore gene flow may be reduced due to post settlement mortality 

MSC
  Environmental heterogeneity is primarily considered a gradient  But can also be patchiness  Patchiness could affect interaction of maladaptation and expansion load  as well as persistence of locally adapted populations  
  Non overlapping generations may affect predictions  How common are species with nonoverlapping generations May alter predictions especially for long lived species if individuals survive initial postsettlement selection and are more likely to reproduce  
  Interesting that gibert model included selfing  but what affect would this have on species that dont self  
  Suggestion to follow Qst and Fst of cohort through life history  but wonder about feasibility  Anyone done this 

Week   Balancing Selection

   What constitutes strong evidence for fluctuating selection  especially if the trait under selection is maintained by many loci with small effects 

UGA 
  Discussion over how expectations play out over distinct life histories  gave example 

WSU 
  Presence of variability does not preclude alternative hypotheses of causation  We think you cant separate phen  Plasticity from underlying genetic structure by looking at phenotype just correlation at the phenotypic level is not strong evidence for fluctuating selection  
  Using definition of selection  have to have genetic info underlying the traits  census of the multiple loci that we think are driving the pattern  Also important to do this over long time period  not snapshot  

UMass Amherst
  Does fluctuating selection require a temporal component Yes  
  How do fluctuations in the ocean depart from seasonality More rooted in large scale climate cycles  el nino  and changes in salinity  tide  environmental conditions  
  Fluctuating selection may contribute to greater diversity which would support higher adaptive capacity in response to changing environments  
  Appreciate isolating fluctuating selection as driver of season adaptive oscillations in drosophilocal adaptationespecially since presence of oscillations could reflect a myriad of ecological conditions  

UCSB 
  Clear that fluctuating selection was maintaining genetic variation among seasonal SNPs independent of other processes such as pleiotropic balancing selection  
  Evidence for fluctuating selection stronger when this pattern exists for multiple alleles that are not in linkage disequilibrium and when the phenomenon can be observed in multiple populations experiencing cyclical shifts in selection  
  Fluctuating selection may be more likely to maintain polymorphisms at multiple alleles of small effect rather than a few alleles of large effect  as fewer alleles are more likely to exhibit an all or nothing pattern that does not maintain variation under fluctuating selective pressures  If so  wonder if evidence of fluctuating selection at small number of alleles requires more investigation than what is present in Bergland paper  
  Fluctuations in direction of selection could simultaneously decrease certain alleles while increasing others  Why do seasonal patterns in bergland paper emerge  more seasonal SNPs in spring  decrease in fall   
  Some alleles should be under greater positive selection during fall and increase in abundance  
  But flies grow faster during warm seasons  so did this allow for beneficial alleles to propagate faster in the spring Life cycles faster than the frequency of selection are the only cases that lend themselves to fluctuating selection and could be broadly important for ectotherms with rapid life cycles  

Uchic GaTech Auburn 
  Fluctuating selection pressures are likely prevalent in marine systems and the extent to which a fluctuating selection pressure produces and maintains genetic variation likely driven by the frequency periodicity of selective regime relative to the species generation time  
  Species with shorter generation times amplify strength of divergent selection acting on a trait across generations  Species with generations that exceed periodicity of the fluctuations are likely to evolve a plastic response with regards to the stressor  
  Specific timing of an environmental fluctuation in respect to the life history stage of a species may also be an important consideration   if sensitive stage occurs in different seasons  
  Identifying the presence of such temporally fluctuating selection difficult because they probably have polygenic basis  so the selective signature of which will be spread across several loci of small effect   Powerfully identifying loci involved in this process within a single population will therefore be difficult  
  Suggest following seasonal fluctuations in genetic variation across multiple replicate populations  separate populations exposed to the same fluctuating selective pressures   Allow for a more powerful way to identify smalleffect loci that exhibit fine scale temporal fluctuations  

Cornell 
  Regarding the Bergland paper  the empirical case is strong  Recognized the interest in estimating the age of these seasonally cycling polymorphisms to address hypotheses about the importance of balancing selection for maintaining polymorphisms  and because it strengthens the balancing selection inference relative to alternative mechanisms  
  However  some thought that balanced polymorphisms neednt be interspecific in age to be interesting and important for patterns of diversity  
  Adaptation to new environment might entail temporal fluctuations not experienced before  such that adaptation is via fluctuation of relatively new variants  
  Question whether old alleles should be a necessary criterion for demonstrating fluctuating selection  
  Short generation time of drosophila made it an excellent model for cycling adaptation to seasonal variation  What types of variation is periodic and regular enough to generate this dynamic for longer lived organisms Elnino maybe  but these arent as symmetrical  
  How irregular can environmental flux be and still maintain diversity by fluctuating selection Partially addressed in second paper  describing conditions for stable balanced polymorphisms in a polygenic model with reversal of dominance and diminishing returns of fitness  
  Curious about reversal of dominance beause it is crucial for model  but unfamiliar  Other papers have shown beneficial reversal of dominance for survival to adulthood in fresh vs  saline water  Dominance depends on environment  is an attribute of the favored allele in each environment  Need easier ways to screen for dominance! 

Laval 
  We first discussed what we came up with from the readings of the two proposed papers  Wittman et al  showed that stable polymorphism at many loci is possible if currently favored alleles are sufficiently dominant  segregation lift   and Bergland paper revealed that typically revealed that typically variable selection contributes to repeatable adaptive oscillations at balanced polymorphisms  
  Showed that seasonal SNPs are enriched among functional genetic regions and present their association with variable phenotypes  starvation tolerance and disease recovery  so there is evidence of fluctuating selection  
  In marine environments  fluctuations are not necessarily representative of seasonality but correspond more to large scale changes like climate cycles  Even assuming seasonality in marine environment to be able to see evidence of Fluctuating selection the generation time should be shorter than the season length  So evidence of FS will be more plausible for organisms with rapid life cycles  Another point is that FS has to be stronger than stabilizing selection to persist  
  Finally  in marine environment  genetic drift is minimized  because of gene flow and generally high Ne  so natural selection is more efficient and more detectable  phenotypically talking  even with many loci of small effect involved  

Rutgers
  Evidence is convincing to us  repeatable allele frequency variation by season  the time vs  space comparison  the links to fitness  plus the natural experiment with frost event   
  Many seem accepting of genomic evidence for fluctuating selection now  but we were relatively skeptical earlier about genomic evidence for local adaptation  Are they that different 
  Set up paper as if theory was established and all they needed was empirical support  Except Wittmann paper makes it clear that theory actually isnt well developed  Bergland paper actually provided evidence for new theory  
  Severe limits in our ability to detect fluctuating selection that acts on many loci with small effects  If effects are small  the frequency changes will be small and or identity of alleles changing frequency will change through time  Makes detection more difficult  
  Discussed segregation lift and mechanisms that could produce temporal changes in dominance  Thought of traits where plasticity is driven by gene expression  including cases in which one allele might be expressed in one environment but the other expressed in the other environment 

MIT WHOI
  Seems like actual phenotypic changes are needed to demonstrate strong evidence for fluctuating selection  Also seems like Bergland paper combined multiple lines of evidence to build convincing argument  Opportunistic experiment before and after frost event helped a lot with making it convincing   

Virtual group 
  This is the big question  
  Fundamentally  it is a question of detecting local adaptation to seasons
  Many loci of small effect  then signal may not be consistent through time  which makes things difficult  But if signal is consistent through time and across populations  the presence of fluctuating selection is fairly compelling  
  How might one experimentally reproduce the signal of seasonal selection
  For marine organisms  especially planktonic species with rapid life cycles  there should be abundant seasons fluctuating selection
  Doing this in the lab might help parse down which environmental factors are the primary component to selection
  But also should figure out how widespread that mechanism is as contributor of genetic variation  
  Necessary to consider what types of organisms and fluctuations may be influenced by this  seasonality works with short lived species  what about elnino Upwelling Etc  

NEU
  Finding a simple allele frequency shift that correlates with some environmental variable is likely not sufficient evidence for selection  However  could be strengthened if found over several repeat measures  many seasons  or if the allele frequency shift is observed in different measurements of a particular environmental variable  
  For example  observing allele shifts correlated with season that are also correlated with latitudinal cline provides stronger evidence that these shifts may be the result of selection on temperature related traits  
  Linking genetic variation and allele frequency data with phenotypic variation could also bolster support of selection over drift  Correlations might be hard to find in highly polygenic traits  

  What are the benefits consequences of fluctuating selection for long term changes in the environment 

WSU
  Maintaining variation is always good for preadaptation for future conditions  esp  under climate change  
  Maintenance of variation necessary but perhaps not sufficient if conditions are different from what has been experienced evolutionarily  
  Havent read much about seasonal maintenance of diversity  
  May also be relationships with generation time scales and time scales of fluctuation  are these papers relevant to marine organisms with seasonal reproductive events and or generation times that span multiple seasons 

UCSB
  Fluctuating selection during longterm changes in the environment maintains heterozygosity and increases standing genetic variation  
  Benefit of standing variation in a system where fluctuating selection occurs is unclear  On flip side  fluctuating selection has to be stronger than stabilizing selection may be capable of canalizing phenotypes that are adaptive under future conditions  
  Scale at which fluctuating selection is occurring relative to the scale at which long term changes in the environment are happening is a crucial consideration  
  Population subject adapted to annual fluctuating selection may not be able to sufficiently respond to an increase in the amplitude of monthly changes  

Uchic GaTech Auburn 
  Bergland paper presents comprehensive analytical framework for examining genome wide patterns of seasonal adaptation that may be useful for future empirical studies  although there were some elements that could be improved  
  To minimize variation  collection protocols should be standardized  same microhabitat  same timing  
  Like the comparison of seasonal SNPs with SNPs from diverged populations to test association with standing genetic variation  however  we felt this comparison would have been more meaningful if they had reported amount of overlap in seasonal SNPs and ancestral SNPs  and given more info on the environmental conditions and seasonality in the ancestral pops  
  Temporal variable selective pressures likely maintain variation within ecologically relevant traits  The standing variation provides raw fuel for adaptive response during a directional shift in the environment  
  Important that as environment shifts  previously adaptive variation for conditions that are becoming increasingly rare diminishes  Therefore  as long as variability continues during the directional shift  anomalous reversions back to previous conditions may induce sharp population declines  

Cornell 
  Argument that fluctuating environments are conducive to these mechanisms maintaining higher standing diversity  improving the odds of successfully weathering rapid environmental change  
  These ideas seem consistent with segregation lift models  

Laval 
  Preserving diversity baseline  fluctuating selection appears to be an advantage to keep stable polymorphism to keep pace with environmental change  FS and sweepstake reproductive success  i e   context of overlapped generations or not   
  Evidence of FS should be more pronounced for discrete generations than overlapping generations  
  When there is balancing selection at a large number of loci genetic load is a potential concern but in the case of segregation lift with diminishingreturns epistasis  however  genetic load does not appear to play important role  
  Advantage disadvantage of FS in invasive species  FS can play a role in invasive species expansion in a case of multiinvading events over time  

Rutgers
  Biggest benefit we saw was the maintenance of polymorphisms in a population upon which selection could later act directionally  Summer fly pops look southern and so pops may be preadapted to more southern climates  
  Effects wouldnt even have to be as wellbalanced as in the fly example  old alleles  but could also be useful when they transiently prolong the survival of an allele  
  By increasing standing genetic variation  fluctuating selection can increase adaptive potential  

MIT WHOI
  Fluctuating selection is mostly beneficial  Requires species to balance decreased extinction risk with a decreased level of absolute adaptation or optimality  
  Consequences will rarely be realized because environment always fluctuates  
  Takes standing genetic variation that is likely to be beneficial for many species in the face of longterm changes in the environment  

Virtual group 
  Most important consequence is maintenance of genetic variation for traits under selection  I feel like there is a fair amount of hand waving about temporal balancing selection maintaining diversity without much elaboration  
  However  fluctuating selection on many different time scales is likely an important driver in this  Should increase adaptive potential and population resilience 

NEU
  Benefit or consequence of fluctuating selection would in part depend on a few factors including the strength of selection  the magnitude of change in selection over a single fluctuation  the relative difference in selection strength among different events within a single fluctuation  and the relative length of an environmental fluctuation to the generation time of a species  
  In fly example  seasonal variation seems strong enough to see shifts in allele frequency between seasons  but not too strong as to drive a particular allele to fixation  or too weak to allow it to drift to fixation   
  Fact that several generations occur within each season may allow sufficient time for population wide shifts in allele frequency to occur  even if selection is not that strong   In this case  fluctuating selection may help maintain a larger amount of genetic variation and possibly contribute to increasing the adaptive capacity of a species if the environmental variables that are fluctuating are also those that are expected to undergo long term changes  

Week  Plasticity
Summary Groups discussed phenotypic plasticity based on Waddingtons classic work  Evolution    and Schaum and Collins   paper on evolution in marine algae  Proc  Of the Royal Society B   

   Compare and contrast the two experiments  In what ways are they similar and different 

LSU 
  Main difference is experiment itself  Waddington used artificial selection to select for particular trait  while Schaum paper enforced a stressful event and let natural selection take its course  
  Probably no mortality in flies  so no fitness disadvantage  while the strong selection event in algae does rely on fitness  
  Waddington paper was trying to demonstrate genetic assimilation via canalization of a trait  question whether it is actually shown  
  Would be interesting to see if flies become canalized for the veinlessness trait if they were heat shocked and then allowed to mate randomly  rather than with just other veinless   Certainly demonstrated canalization which was also observed in some of the Schaum paper 
  Schaum paper demonstrated that algae grown in stable high CO environments had higher growth at control levels of CO  Algae grown in fluctuating environments had greater plasticity and were able to have normal growth rates under normal CO conditions demonstrating that a trait that is plastic under high CO scenarios can become canalalized if it is continuously exposed to these conditions  

NEU 
  Baseline difference was focus of Waddington on a purportedly nonadaptive variant through artificial selection vs  the direct focus on adaptive natural selection  
  While Waddington focused on stable exposure  Schaum focused on fluctuating vs  stable exposure  
  Both experiments highlight broad umbrella of crossgenerational plasticity  Waddington paper focused on immediate responses of a stable temperature change as opposed to the effect of a fluctuating exposure  

FSU 
  Possible interpretation of waddingtons work is that the variation for that trait was in ancestral populations and that environmentally induced phenotype were actually present in the original wild stock and plastic phenotype was not actually plastic but rather a kind of threshold trait  
  Alleles for veinlessness are expressed after the heat shock exceeded some threshold for expression  then just increased in frequency over multiple generations of artificial selection for crossveinlessness  

UC Davis 
  Schaum uses Ostreococcus which is large pop of marine microbes with short gen times and ample scope of evolution  while Waddington uses drosophila with smaller pop sizes and slower mutation rates  
  Schaum starts with  strains that differ in plasticity before the start of the experiment  Waddington uses one
  Schaum exposes both stressors and fluctuating environment  wadington only exposes one stressfull environment against ambient  
  Waddingtons trait not adaptive  Schaum saw adaptiveness
  Waddington did a lot of back crosses to fid genetic architecture which Schaum did not do  
  Waddington did no measure a fitness trait  do not kow whether mutated flies would survive or not  Schaum tested some fitness traits  baldwins   
  Waddington gives empirical evidence of a case where nonheritable environmentally induced variation is converted ito heritable variation  Initially this is cryptic genetic variation  will it become adaptive 
  Both have no idea about genetic architecture of the traits  
  Both investigate environmental drivers of phenotypic variation  
  Both show genetic assimilation

  Appreciate clear experimental design in waddingtons paper that first aimed to evolve plasticity and then test the extent that it augments evolution  Does seem difficult to be convinced that their metric of plasticity  o consumption in  environments  was able to resolve whether the phenotypic variation in the FA line was driven by increased genetic variation or plasticity  
  Revisited Botero et al     Model explored conditions under which plasticity is expected to evolve  Focal parameters of model were time scale of fluctuation and predictability of environmental switch  
  Environmental switch in schaum is not predictable and time scale is long relative to generation time  
  Under such scenarios  Botero predicts reversible plasticity is not favored but rather a diversified bethedging or adaptive in which phenotypic variation among individuals is fixed and genetic variation is maintained to facilitate adaptation to sudden and random shift in the environment  
  Hard to be certain this isnt what happened in the FA line of the Schaum paper  as ultimate result of FA line evolving faster would be increased genetic variation in that line  
  More robust if they could track patterns of genetic variation in each lines to ensure that this metric did not accumulate disproportionately across treatments

  Waddington paper selected arbitrary trait with no ecological relevance or fitness consequences  Schaum picked oxygen evolution rates as example of plastic trait with adaptive value as well as strong selective pressures on fitness related traits that are ecologically relevant  
  Two experiments used different selective pressures Schaum used stable and fluctuating pCO treatments to drive selection rather than the artificial selection of crossveinless phenotype
  Direction of evolved trait differed between two experiments  Waddington demonstrated that genetic assimilation via canalization of phenotypic trait is unidirectional whereas in the case of Schaum et al the evolved trait was in the opposite direction of the evolved response  
  Schaums effort to raise   generations of variation adapted lines in static pco environment in order to rule out maternal effects as the driver of the adaptive pattern  While Waddington demonstrated the crossveinless was clearly heritable  we were not convinced that the increase in frequency of this phenotyp wasnt tied to maternal effects  
  Acquired characters could have been cryptic genetic variation that manifested as a phenotype due to plasticity and increased in frequency across heat stressed generations via transgenerational effects

  Discussed how these two papers both investigate environmental drivers of phenotypic variation and in both cases how genetic architecture of trait is unknown  
  In both studies  genetic assimilation was observed 
  Classical paper such as waddingtons compared to newer paper  differences between two studies  
  Constrast between types of traits examined differed between papers  fitness vs  non fitness trait  
  Schaum demonstrates that evolutionary trajectory can be determined by ancestral plasticity  Agreed that in both papers  findings were close to proposed hypotheses  
  Plasticity and amount of plasticity required was addressed and how plasticity allows for flexible pathways which allow shifts in the default  

  How does plasticity in ancestral populations determine evolutionary trajectory 

LSU 
  The more plastic the population  the more those populations seemed to evolve  Schaum paper clearly demonstrated that evolutionary trajectory can be determined by the ancestral plasticity  
  Wish there were more discussion on whether the evolutionary trajectory is always going to be beneficial for population  
  Lower growth rates might seem disadvantageous  authors do a nice job of explaining this can provide fitness advantage but want more empirical support  
  Dont think the direction of evolution can be determined by plasticity and whether those changes will be beneficial or maladaptive

  Consider situations where plasticity is cyclical  or appears that way   In some environments  could be beneficial to be increasingly plastic while in others it may be beneficial to canalize around fixed phenotype  
  Discussed situation in which canalization may be a periodic point of evolution but there could be sufficient variation maintained around the canalized slope that could allow for plasticity to reevolve if the environment changes and plasticity becomes adaptive again  sensu Lande et al     
  Consider how timing of environmental exposure can affect plasticity vs  canalization  Some traits can be developmentally plastic  but once induced  become fixed in the phenotype even if the environment changes  
  In contrast  some responses like gene expression are much more flexible and responsive to continual fluctuations in the environment  Differences could have important implications for the ultimate fitness and evolutionary trajectory of species

  More plastic lineages evolved faster than the less plastic ones  
  Why does plasticity in one trait make the population strain evolve faster in another trait Apparently two traits are correlated  
  Generally it would depend on strength and direction of selection as well as on the standing genetic variation in a population  
  If there is no underlying variation  a population might not adapt  I E  adaptive plasticity can be so good it prevents adaptive evolution because the all purpose genotype produces an optimal phenotype in every environment  
  There is potential for adaptation  as long as the change in mean trait value goes into the same direction favored by selection in the new environment but below the adaptive peak

  Results from schaum paper demonstrate that evolutionary trajectory can be determined by ancestral plasticity  Ostreococcus lineages founded from more plastic ancestors evolved more in high pCO environments than lineages founded from less plastic ancestors supporting the relationship between plasticity and evolution  
  With many ecological and evolutionary concepts  the adage it depends applies here  Plasticity does not always confer an adaptive benefit  in some cases  such as in a fluctuating environment  it benefits the population to maintain a degree of plasticity  In others  such as in a more stable environment  the costs outweigh the benefits of plasticity and the evolutionary trajectory leads in a direction away from the plastic population  
  Even in this scenario  it depends on generation time of focal organism  frequency and duration of environmental fluctuation  etc  

  Do empirical results agree or disagree with theoretical arguments 

LSU 
  They agree  
  Past theoretical arguments converged on plasticity hindering a populations ability to evolve  more recent theoretical work seems to demonstrate the opposite  
  Plasticity enhances evolution adaptation to new environments and Schaum paper results agree  

NEU
  Plasticity should counteract true adaptive evolution and only if your plastic response happens to align with directional selection can in improve response rates to environmental stressors  
  Repeatedly refer back to fishers geometric model to visualize misaligned plastic potentials with adaptive gradients  
  The role of epigenetics in plasticity provides one particular mechanism of plasticity that requires more explicit study before broader theoretical models can be properly tested  
  Given theoretical predictions around genetic assimilation and plasticity  there are some theoretical scenarios that could only be supported once explicit mechanisms are more properly understood with epigenetics being the elephant in the room  
  Relying too much on a single mechanistic determinant of plasticity can be a pitfall  and the theoretical value of work observing plastic responses  even in the absence of clear mechanisms is evident by the fact that we collectively read and compared a research article written almost  years ago to discuss the many still unsanswerd questions about plasticity

  Way authors define and use genetic assimilation seems to be slightly different to use Waddingtons version  
  Some definitions of GA are that it is a process that converts a plastic response into a genetically invariant one  If one considers plasticity itself  slope of reaction norm  as a quantitative phenotypic trait subject to selection and capable of evolving like any other quantitative trait  
  When viewing plasticity as quantitative trait  idea that responses to environmental change are through plasticity or evolution or the idea that plasticity promotes or affects evolution seem odd  
  Larger environmental changes could more easily be bridged by a plastic genotype  When environment is constant  there is no longer selection for plasticity so the reaction norm slope does not evolve or evolves to zero  
  Rate of environmental fluctuation was slow relative to generation time  so some environments were both variable and predictable and these treatments selected for plasticity  
  Results of schaum and Collins consistent with predictions from quantitative genetic theory that treats plasticity itself as a trait

  As Ghalambor points out adaptive plasticity that places populations close enough to a new phenotypic optimum for directional selection to act is the only plasticity that predictably enhances fitness and is most likely to facilitate adaptive evolution on ecological time scales in new environments  
  This type of plasticity is likely to be the product of past selection on variation that may have been initially nonadaptive  
  Historically  theory suggested that selection acts on nonheritable phenotypic variation will not produce an evolutionary response is unimportant   wtf  
  Environmentally induced variation might slow rate of adaptive evolution because it is shielding the genotype from the effects of selection  
  But westeberhard showed that plasticity can become GA or speed up process of adaptive evolution  For this to work  there needs to be initial phenotypic variation plasticity and the population needs to be faced with an environmental change following directional selection  
  May be disadvantageous at first to be plastic but the cost is not high relative to selective pressure  In other words  only those that are plastic can survive  
  But later directional selection will favor the new trait and genes coding for it will be under direct selection  Ultimately  selection might cause a variable trait to be fixed in the future  This depends on whether the environment changes to a new state or is fluctuating  Invasion bio is good place to study this  
  How likely is it Will majority of populations die instead of resisting to new directional selection Is maintaining phenotypic variation in a constant environment costly
  As ghalambor points out adaptations to new environments rarely involve single traits but rather suites of traits that respond to diverse selection pressures  Brings us back to week  where we discussed genetic correlations between different life stages of an organism  Might constrain potential for plasticity  

UCSB
  Empirical results agree with more recent theoretical arguments regarding plasticitys ability to reveal genetic variation at the phenotypic level  allow slection to occur across a greater number of otherwise cryptic genetic variants  plasticity promotes evolutionary innovation or adaptation and schaum paper demonstrates this  
  Previous evolutionary theories regarding plasticity have noted that it may limit adaptive potential  Schaum demonstrated that not all selective pressures result in adaptive responses by plastic populations  Can help synthesize competing theories regarding plasticitys role in evolution
